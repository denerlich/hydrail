Fuelling
Diesel locomotives presently operating on the network are fuelled every day at one of the three
permanent exterior fuelling facilities in Barrie, Mimico, and Lincolnville. In the case of Mimico, all trains
coming through the site are first directed to stop at the fuelling station regardless of the tank fuel
level.
The diesel locomotives operating on the GO network have a fuel tank that can carry up to
2,200 United States gallons (USG), or approximatively 8,330 L of fuel. Based on a witnessed fill rate at
the Mimico fuel station of 375 L/min, it would take less than 23 minutes to fill an empty tank. Assuming
that this operational process is appropriate to apply to the Hydrail System, we consider that a target
fuelling time for a new Hydrail locomotive should be between 20 and 25 minutes.
Detailed assessment of modifications required to the existing maintenance facilities and additional
review of the maintenance plan will be needed to properly evaluate the impact on Hydrail’s O&M
cycle. The revised maintenance approach can also provide opportunities to further optimize the new
hydrogen dispensing system. For example, fuelling stations can be designed to fill from both sides of
the locomotives at the same time, or maintenance activities like sand refilling, water and waste
management, and daily service cleaning could also be done in parallel to either maintain or reduce
the existing maintenance cycle time.
The existing direct truck to locomotive access points available at most stations on the network could
continue to be used for the Hydrail System primarily for emergency situations.

4.2.2

Hydrail System Operation Modelling

This study is a preliminary assessment and is subject to some uncertainties in moving the RER network
from diesel to electric propulsion, either using track electrification or Hydrail. There are several
scenarios for how the RER network will be deployed. This study focusses on RER Scenario 5 and the
assumptions of Metrolinx’s published IBC for electrification. It is decidedly a preliminary assessment
that deals only with major cost items.
One source of uncertainty comes from the make-up of the train consists. With the agreement of
Metrolinx, for locomotive-pulled consists, the Hydrail configuration uses a 2-locomotive, 12-coach
configuration. This was primarily chosen to provide sufficient space for on-board hydrogen storage
for a full-day’s operation without refuelling96. Moreover, this configuration also offers operational
flexibility of deploying half-sized trains for off-peak service97.
RER Scenario 5 also includes self-propelled double-deck EMUs, and the cost comparison for this
situation is less straightforward, since fuel storage and fuel cells would replace electrificationassociated power equipment. Fuel cells are notably compact, but hydrogen fuel storage is bulky. As
for most other gas-fuelled passenger-transport vehicles, single-deck EMUs can use the space above
the carriage roofs for fuel storage, but the limitation of overhead clearance constrains this option with
double-deck EMUs. So, the precise effect of fitting Hydrail into double-deck EMUs has still to be
determined and could reduce passenger-carrying capacity. This introduces some uncertainty into the
cost comparison.

96 A single locomotive design that has sufficient space for the required hydrogen storage remains a possibility, but identifying such a
design is a subject for subsequent study.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

With the Hydrail System, the unprecedented scale of fuel-cell power that would be deployed on
individual trains brings some cost uncertainty, even for this modular technology. However, that
uncertainty has to be seen in the context of steadily declining costs for the key equipment
components, a trend expected to continue.
Operating cost estimates are also subject to uncertainty, since they depend on forecasting electricity
prices over the medium and long terms. Unlike track electrification’s electricity costs, which have no
scope for optimization, the Hydrail System can respond to an electricity price structure that is different
from today’s because of its intrinsic ability to switch its demand for electrical energy, to take
advantage of the lowest prices of electricity each day.

4.2.2.1

Electricity Supply and Costs

At the centre of the case for Hydrail and its costs is the supply and price of electricity, either from the
Ontario electricity grid or from electrical generating stations without the market price structure.
Ontario Electrical Grid Current Energy Supply
Ontario’s electricity supply is predominantly carbon dioxide (CO2)-emissions-free (or green energy)98.
Here, green energy refers to various energy and electricity conversion processes that rely on energy
sources in nature that do not contribute to the emission of CO2 from fossilized carbon-based fuels,
such as coal, natural gas, and crude oil. Ontario’s electricity demand fluctuates both daily and
seasonally, as shown on Figure 4-16.

Supply has difficulty in matching demand, which is illustrated as follows:

In recent years, the proportion of wind and solar generation in Ontario has been increasing, and the
proportion of time when the Ontario grid has excess electricity has been rising. The proportion of
time when HOEP has negative or zero value over the last 6 years is shown on Figure 4-17. This reflects
a rising surplus of generating capacity from nuclear and renewable sources that cannot readily be
curtailed. The grid is burdened with an unwanted supply of electricity of no value that it still has to pay
the suppliers for.

Electricity Price Estimates for the Hydrail System
The IESO data (Figure 4-18) show that Ontario’s grid
is supplied by generating processes that are
distinctively unusual in two ways:

Variability of demand exists on almost every time
scale from night and day to seasonal.

Adding together these three factors, the Ontario grid experiences very substantial surpluses of green
electricity every day. The cost of this unwanted electricity is recovered by the Global Adjustment (GA).
The cost of electricity for either Hydrail or track electrification is crucially important to the choice
between the two technologies. The entire premise of Hydrail is that hydrogen will be generated by
accessing this unwanted electricity. In storing electricity as hydrogen, it will time-shift energy demand
by tapping into the unwanted surplus. Consequently, it is our understanding that electricity for Hydrail
would not be subject to the GA.
In contrast, the power required for the Overhead Contact System (OCS) does not alleviate the supplydemand imbalance and would, therefore, likely be subject to GA.
After discussion with IESO102, we have costed the operational cost of the Hydrail System based on
IESO’s actual hourly HOEP figures for 2016, plus the additional charges for distribution and
regulation. Our estimates of electricity costs to produce hydrogen are based on selecting times with
the lowest electricity values for hydrogen production. The results of this analysis are shown in
Table 4-17, in the row identified as IESO set.

However, whether 2016 prices will precisely reflect electricity prices from 2024 on Table 4-18, to a
large extent, uncertain because, on the generating supply side, there are planned additions of
capacity and, on the demand side, there is the potential for growth in time-sensitive demand from
vehicles powered either by electric batteries or hydrogen.
A report by Strategic Policy Economics103 argues the case for hydrogen storage in a seasonal
timeframe and concludes that: “The Hydrogen Economy can provide capacity and reliability benefits
to the electricity system … to smooth the seasonal differences …”. The basic premise of this report is
that the imbalances are going to persist. The Hydrail approach takes this principle further by
smoothing the imbalances over days rather than seasonally.
One variable that might bear on the cost of hydrogen for Hydrail would be a future compression or
spread of the variation of hourly electricity costs around the mean. To examine this, the 2024 base
case was re-optimized with the same average electricity cost but with all HOEP values moved either
20 percent closer to the mean or 20 percent away from the mean. The results are also provided in
Table 4-17.
The difference between the 2016 spread in HOEP prices and those projected for 2024 by IESO is
about 25 percent compression, so the range in Table 4-17 is well within the bounds of possibility. The
contrast between the cases with the 20 percent expansion and the 20 percent compression of prices
shows that effects of compression are diminishing, and further compression would be unimportant.

4.2.2.2 Hydrail System Costs and Scenarios
Hydrogen Handling Phases: Gas or Liquid
For both capital and operating costs, the form in which hydrogen is stored—either as liquid hydrogen
(LH2) or CGH2)—has bearing on this uncertainty because liquid hydrogen is 80 percent denser than
gas at 700 atmospheres. The disadvantages of using LH2 are discussed in Section 4.1.4.1, but its use
has been retained as an option for costing. Cost estimates for four hydrogen delivery configurations
for Hydrail have been prepared as follows:


Central production with pipeline delivery as gas throughout the RER network



Central production with delivery by truck as gas



Central production with delivery by truck as LH2



Distributed onsite production as gas

Producing and Costing Hydrogen
Hydrogen requirements are estimated for RER Scenario 5’s planned train service pattern.
The cost of producing hydrogen is based on the hourly costs of HOEP (plus fixed electricity charges),
the cost of electrolysis installations ($655/ kilowatt [kW]104 at a nominal 2.2 A/cm2 of current density),
and the cost of hydrogen storage ($1,397/kg105). A minimum of these cost inputs is found by varying
storage and electrolysis capacity, and a complex set of conditions to determine when hydrogen will
be produced and at what rate (varied by changing the current density, which modulates the cell

voltage so also the electricity consumption, using figures supplied by Hydrogenics106) and based on
the hourly price of electricity and the level of hydrogen in storage.
The study had initially used the IESO pattern of HOEP in 2016 as input, with the actual cost escalated
using IESO’s Large Industrial Price Forecast Module 4 (selected pertinent parts are provided in
Table 4-18). IESO subsequently supplied their projection of HOEP prices through 2035107. In the
absence of information beyond 2035, the figures for 2035 have been assumed to apply to subsequent
years.

The newer IESO set was used for this assessment. The DRC for either 2024 or 2032 were added to
IESO’s projected HOEP. GA costs have been excluded based on the understanding that they will not
be applied to applications of RER’s nature. The DRC cost element in electricity charges ceases
after 2018.
Water requirements to produce hydrogen are for direct conversion plus evaporative losses to
dissipate heat through a cooling tower; details of the cooling tower have not been assessed, but this
is a minor item of equipment.
Hydrogen Use
Hydrogen produced by electrolysis will move to Hydrail-powered trains in the form either of
compressed gas or LH2. For the main deployment of storage, compressed gas would be stored at
200 to 300 bar in conventional, high-pressure steel tanks, and LH2 in double-walled vacuum vessels.
Four options have been costed:
1. As gas with production at a central site remote from the refuelling points and then delivered to the
train refuelling points by a pipeline.
2. Same as 1., but with gas delivered by tube-trailer-carrying trucks.
3. Same as 1., but with liquid hydrogen delivered by truck; in this case, the costs of liquefaction have
been added. A liquefaction plant would run continuously, and the additional electricity is costed at
the average electricity price, including GA.
4. As gas produced by electrolysis close to the train refuelling points. (Because electrolysis is
intrinsically modular, production could be divided between several sites with little impact on cost.)

In either gas or liquid form, storage capacity (as days of RER Hydrail demand) is determined by the
hydrogen production optimization. Storage for an additional 1 day of demand is added to provide
overnight refuelling of the RER fleet. The land areas for these hydrogen-supply options have been
estimated and costed. These costs are preliminary, as the actual location of the generation, storage,
and dispensing facilities are unknown.
Hydrail Operational Scenarios – Description
There are several operational scenarios being considered for Hydrail, taking advantage of flexibilities
that hydrogen technology must offer for the rail application. To simplify discussions, the Hydrail
operational scenarios are grouped in various ways:
1. Infrastructure Configuration Scenario: The Hydrail system as shown on Figure 4-13 comprises
various subsystems that may or may not be required, depending on the nature of hydrogen
required (gaseous vs. liquid) and the option of producing hydrogen locally or remotely.
2. 2024-Cost Case: This is the high-cost scenario where all the Hydrail infrastructure and vehicle
components assume the start of the RER Scenario 5 (2024) costs—though these are projected to
decline as the volume of production of these components grows.
3. Future-Cost Case: This is a low-cost case where the component costs presume projected future
costs reflecting both design advances and increasing volume of production as demand from other
applications of hydrogen technology grow. The other applications are discussed in Section 3.3, all
increasing production of similar components for hydrogen-fuelled cars, buses, transport trucks,
ships, and forklifts. Demand from stationary applications for the electrical grid and for renewable
energy storage, CHP, and back-up power has already been expanding.
4. Low-Power Case: The base-case assumption uses a locomotive peak power of 7,500 horsepower
(hp) (5,593 kW). This requirement is derived from the initial acceleration required for a full train
consist. It may be too large, so a low-power case was included at 6,500 hp (4,847 kW) to show the
sensitivity to this variable.
5. Fleet Mix Scenario: Since Hydrail would use 2 locomotives for every 12 bi-level coaches, this
allows an option of splitting the train consist into two 1+6 (as discussed in Section 4.1.8.3),
resulting in the same economy of operation as EMUs. There are two fleet-mix options: (1)
combination of locomotives and EMUs in the fleet; and (2) only locomotives in the fleet.
6. RER Scenario 4108: RER Scenario 5 deploys Hydrail exclusively on Lakeshore East, and a mix of
Hydrail and diesel on Lakeshore West, Barrie, Stouffville, and Kitchener. Whereas, RER Scenario 4
is a more extensive deployment with Hydrail exclusively on all GO corridors.
Equipment Capital Cost Sensitivities
Costs for various equipment and subsystems within the Hydrail system is estimated based on cost
factors available from hydrogen technical literature and from market relevant data obtained via
stakeholder engagements. These factors for the two cost cases described earlier for key equipment
are provided in Table 4-19.

A main attraction of Hydrail is that it is an assembly of components from a suite of relatively young
technologies whose costs have been falling steadily over time and are expected to continue to fall.
This is particularly true of the PEM technology (for both the electrolysis and fuel cell equipment) where
Ballard109 has supplied the projections for fuel cell costs, as shown on Figure 4-19.

For the 2024-case, this study used 1197 $/kWe, as provided in Table 4-19. While that looks somewhat
high for 2024, the Ballard numbers could themselves not fully reflect the economies of scale in fuelcell production. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimated110 current costs for
manufacture of PEM fuel cells in very large numbers ranging from:


US$280/kWe for 20,000 units



US$60/kWe for 100,000 units



US$53/kWe for 500,000

While those numbers look highly optimistic, they indicate the likely trend of prices as production of
PEM fuel cells expands to support other transportation applications using hydrogen.

The diesel locomotive is used as the reference for the Hydrail locomotive in the table. Based on
discussions with rail vehicle experts, the cost for electric locomotives listed in the IBC at $6 million is
quite low. To address this deficiency and enable a like-for-like comparison to the Hydrail locomotive,
the cost of diesel is reduced by half from $ 7 to 3.5 million, as per Table 4-20.
From the above table, the cost of a Hydrail locomotive is the result of: 3.5-1+3.86 = $6.4 million. Note
here that 3.86 is the cost of the hydrogen equipment onboard the locomotive, as shown on
Figure 4-20.

4.2.2.3 Hydrail Operational Simulation Model: Design and Characteristics
The Hydrail operational model is designed based on techno-economic assessment capabilities for the
individual subsystems, as shown on Figure 4-13. The design of the Hydrail Operational Simulation
Model is summarized by the flowchart shown on Figure 4-22.

Key Model Setup for Electricity Price Optimization
This section explains how the CNL Hydrail Model operates to minimize the cost of electricity. It gives a
sense of the level of details involved in the techno-economic estimates for the GO Hydrail System.
The objective of the optimization process is to produce hydrogen at the lowest possible cost, taking
into consideration both the price of electricity (the HOEP set by the IESO) and the amortized cost of
capital. Actual HOEP values for 2016 are the basis used for this optimization. Other cost factors, such
as the levies for distribution and administrative costs, can be added to the HOEP: HOEP+. These
HOEP+ values are deployed in an Excel spreadsheet with one row for each hour of the year.

At the two extremes:


One could deploy a massive installation of capital equipment to produce a year’s supply of
hydrogen in the single hour of lowest HOEP+ and store it for the entire year’s consumption.



One could produce hydrogen continuously with a minimum of capital equipment and only
enough storage capacity to provide for a concentrated daily period of train refuelling.

The optimized solution lies between those two extremes, deploying enough electrolysis cell and
storage capacity to produce hydrogen intermittently to take advantage of periods with low HOEP+.
Because HOEP follows a highly erratic pattern, there is no smooth function to determine the optimum.
Instead, the optimizing model allows the user to search for an optimum between the two extremes by
varying the sizes of the electrolysis equipment and storage capacity.
The user also has a series of operating variables that are set to determine whether hydrogen should
be produced depending on HOEP+ and the level of hydrogen in storage. A final variable allows
operation of the electrolysis equipment at a higher current density up to a specified maximum; this is
intended to allow the system to leverage its advantage when HOEP+ is notably low, even though
higher current density raises the electricity consumption to produce a unit of hydrogen. The model
tracks the quantity of hydrogen in storage (expressed in hours of average demand) and uses this to
determine the minimum current HOEP+ value that will be accepted for hydrogen production.
For an acceptable solution, the quantity of hydrogen in storage must always meet refuelling demand;
refuelling is assumed to occur uniformly between midnight and 6 a.m. Hydrogen production is
curtailed so that the storage capacity is never exceeded. On the assumption that hydrogen
production will not change electricity prices, the cost of producing hydrogen by electrolysis is
assumed to be indifferent to how much needs to be produced; any desired quantity is obtained by
linear scaling.
Optimization of parameters listed and referenced in this section allows the user to set two physical
variables: (1) the quantities of electrolysis equipment, and (2) the hydrogen storage capacity. The
other parameters determine when the electrolyzers will draw power. Basically, there are three bands
of electricity price: (3) is a basic low price; (4) is a higher price if the storage level (5) is running low;
and (6) is a storage level that is considered so low that production of hydrogen will occur at any
HOEP+. (7) allows the cell current density to be raised to up to three times the nominal density. This
produces hydrogen in proportion to the current density, but the voltage rises with current density
according to a formula supplied by Hydrogenics; power used is current density multiplied by voltage.
An optimization set is indicated and disqualified if, at any point in the year, the hydrogen in storage
drops to zero. Production is curtailed or switched off when storage is full.
The parameters on the System tab of the Hydrail Model are:
1. Available quantity of electrolysis equipment (a multiple of the requirement for 24 hours per day,
7 days per week [24/7] continuous production)
2. Available quantity of hydrogen storage (in hours of average demand)
3. A threshold electricity price below which hydrogen can always be produced ($/kWh), subject to
space in storage being available
4. A higher threshold electricity price below which hydrogen can be produced ($/kWh) if …
5. … hydrogen storage is less than specified percentage of storage capacity
6. An extreme low level of storage (in hours), below which electricity at any price will be accepted

7. A threshold electricity price below which the cell current density can be raised from its standard
level of 2.2 A/cm2 for a PEM electrolyzer to as high as ...
8. … a (higher) current density level with the power consumption adjusted according to PEM
electrolyzer characteristics supplied by Hydrogenics.
Variables 3 to 8 determined the rate at which hydrogen should be produced in any hour-long period
at a rate that reflected available storage space and current HOEP+. The rate ranged from zero (when
the electricity price was high and storage levels acceptable), to a standard rate (when considerations
of electricity price and storage justify production), to an augmented rate with a higher current density
(when the electricity price was acceptably low).
The variables were adjusted manually to search for the best result. Any optimization unable at any
time to meet fuelling demand is alarmed and rejected.
The eight variables are adjusted manually, usually (but not necessarily) to produce the lowest overall
cost of electricity plus capital recovery. As an example, the average daily distribution of the hydrogen
production for Hydrail in the year 2024 would look something like that shown in Figure 4-23.

4.2.2.4 Hydrail Operational Scenarios – Results
Results from the Hydrail Operational Simulation Model were generated for the scenarios discussed
earlier. Here, the costs provided do not include any financial assumptions and conditions, so they are
direct costs (without any discounting for future time periods), mainly based on equipment cost factors
and electricity pricing. These are presented here to highlight the difference between various options
that are available within the Hydrail infrastructure for both fixed and mobile assets.
Infrastructure Configuration Scenario
The Hydrail System configuration involves locating and grouping fixed subsystems that take
advantage of some characteristics of hydrogen and relevant equipment that handles hydrogen.
Table 4-21 shows the results of four configuration scenarios for the 2024-cost case.

The hydrogen and water requirement shown in the table are the same for all scenarios. The water
consumed by the Hydrail system would be equivalent to about 0.04 percent of the daily water
consumption by the City of Toronto. Most of this water would return to Ontario and the Great Lakes
region via rainfall as the trains operate on the GO network every day using the hydrogen produced
from this water.

The results for the four configuration scenarios are distinct, and some aspects are discussed here:
1. Central production with pipeline distribution: There is about 367 km of pipeline, representing the
physical length of the GO corridors within the RER Scenario 5, on the assumption that hydrogen
could be made available anywhere on the entire network. In reality, this number would be
different, as we would determine more details on the location of production as the next step. The
land area for this scenario is larger than others due to the lower pressure of hydrogen that the
pipeline could accommodate; thereby, increasing the number of storage tanks.

Revision B

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

2. Central production with truck distribution for gaseous hydrogen: There are about 83 trucks (each
carrying about 800 kg of hydrogen) required each day to transport the 40 tonnes of hydrogen
produced to the various refuelling locations. While this is cheaper than the pipeline option for gas,
having these many trucks on the road every day increases the risk for supply disruption.
3. Central production with truck distribution for liquid hydrogen: The number of trucks is down to
13 in this scenario, as each liquid hydrogen truck could carry about 4,200 kg of hydrogen. But this
option puts a huge penalty on the Hydrail system energy requirements from 2.2 to 2.7 GWh/d, an
increase of 18 percent of daily electricity consumption. The storage tanks are also specialized,
which increases the cost of storage by 74 percent. However, this option requires the lowest land
area due to the higher density of storage.
4. Onsite production: This has the lowest cost of the four scenarios, as the cost for distribution is
discounted. If the land area required (16,166 m2) is available at or near the site of the refuelling or
dispensing facilities, then this could be the preferred option for Hydrail infrastructure.
Cost and Timeframe Scenarios: 2024 and Future Cost Cases
As discussed earlier in Section 4.2.2.2, the capital cost of hydrogen equipment used in various Hydrail
subsystems is changing with time due to the evolution in the technology and the volume of
production of this equipment. Using the two cost cases in the Hydrail model, the reduced costs for the
future-cost case are provided in Table 4-22 for the onsite production scenario. Note that the
deployment of the vehicles in the fleet would continue until 2044 (based on train service pattern), so a
comparison is provided for the two cost cases to that timeframe, as well.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

Between the 2024-cost and future-cost cases (columns 3 and 5 in Table 4-22), the production
subsystem cost is reduced by 20 percent; production storage by 23 percent; refuelling storage by
16 percent; and dispensing equipment by 20 percent. There is approximately a 16 percent reduction
in costs for the powered vehicle fleet – Hydrail locomotives and drive EMUs (not shown in the table).
These reductions would only be realized for equipment purchased after the initial Hydrail infrastructure,
which is set at the 2024 costs. The reduction would affect the additional infrastructure required to
support the progressive increase in vehicle fleet by 2044 and any replacements made during this time
and beyond. The fleet addition reflected for the 2044 case, with 18 additional locomotives, is presented
in the IBC report112. It is also important to remember that the number of HFC locomotives is twice the
number of electric locomotives in the IBC report.
However, the additional requirement for hydrogen of about 8 tpd for 2044 is reflective of the train
service pattern for each corridor, which could be indicative of a higher number of trains being added to
the corridors. Based on the service pattern used in the Hydrail Operational Simulation Model, the
addition of trains extends beyond 2030, up to 2044 in some corridors.
In this respect, the Hydrail estimates are higher than the electrification (OCS) ones beyond the 2030
timeframe, which requires careful consideration when a comparison of lifetime costs is made.
Peak Power Scenario
The hydrogen requirement and every other aspect of the Hydrail system was deduced based on the
peak and average power requirements for the locomotives and EMUs. When the peak power is
adjusted without much sacrifice on the acceleration of the entire train, the change in the system and
cost parameters are highlighted in Table 4-23. A 20 percent reduction in peak power between the
two cases: 7500 and 6000 hp, respectively, shows a significant reduction in costs and energy
requirements, for a 11 percent reduction in the acceleration of the train.

The train consist considered for this scenario is made up of 2 locomotives pulling 12 bi-level coaches
with all seats occupied by passengers, with a total of 882 tonnes of gross weight. The time to
accelerate was set at 60 seconds. If the time savings to passengers is calculated and weighed against
the cost savings to the Hydrail System for a slightly slower commute, then the peak power comparison
should be scrutinized further. Note that the acceleration numbers chosen here are arbitrary just to
show the impact of peak power on the acceleration and the entire system.
Fleet Mix Scenario
The Hydrail fleet mix is included as a scenario and follows the discussions in Section 4.1.8.3, where
having 2 locomotives with 12 bi-level coaches (2+12 consist) was flexible enough to be used as 1+6
consist during off-peak times of rail operations within the GO corridors. Table 4-24 provides a
comparison between the fleet with a mix of locomotives and EMUs versus a fleet with only
locomotives.

The biggest change is in the powered vehicles’ cost, with the locomotives-only option providing a
saving of 46 percent when compared to the initial capital cost of the Hydrail system at the 2024
timeframe using the 2024-costs. The significance highlighted here is an indication to scrutinize this
option of having only locomotives for the Hydrail system, provided the locomotives could achieve a
similar time savings as purported to be achieved using EMUs.
RER Scenario 4 Option
RER Scenario 4 assumes that the entire GO network in the current layout would be electrified and in
2024 timeframe and would have a mix of existing diesel-powered vehicles and hydrogen- or electricpowered vehicles in the fleet. The comparison of results between Scenarios 4 and 5 are provided in
Table 4-25. The addition in the hydrogen, energy, water, and operating requirements for Scenario 4
implies the scope of the full GO network electrification. The additional capital required for the fixed
infrastructure is also significant. Due to the modular nature of the technologies involved, Hydrail
would be implemented in stages while taking advantage of lessons learned while implementing
Hydrail subsystems in the GO corridors initially, so these numbers should be used only for the relative
difference between the scenarios compared.

Electricity Policy and Pricing

Electricity is the flow of electrons from a negatively charged body to a positively charged body113.
Electricity is commonly used in everyday life as a source of energy for a wide range of applications,
including lighting, heating, and powering appliances or other motorized equipment. Power is the rate
(energy amount per time period) at which energy converted (Figure 4-24). The scientific unit of power
is the watt (W), which is equal to one joule (energy amount) per second (time period)114.
FIGURE 4-24 ELECTRIC POWER MEASURES

The amount of electricity that is generated or used over a period of time is typically measured in
kWh115. A watthour is equal to the energy of 1 watt steadily generated or supplied over 1 hour
(Figure 4-25).
FIGURE 4-25 WATT-HOUR MEASURES

Ontario has seen a net increase in electricity production from 2005 to 2015, with production growing
from 156TWh to 160TWh. The growth in production has however, not been met by increased
demand. Changing economic conditions and conservation programs have resulted in non-weathercorrected grid demand116 within the province declining by approximately 10 percent from 151TWh in
2006 to 137TWh in 2015. Accordingly, Ontario currently generates significant surplus electricity,
estimated at 9 percent of Ontario’s net demand in 2016, a major change from the deficits that existed
in the early 2000s.

As the province seeks to improve efficiencies, plans through to 2035 focussed on improvement in the
alignment between demand and supply of electricity, and continuing conservation initiatives and
demand response programs. The following sections will describe the governance and policy
framework that guide strategic planning for Ontario’s electricity needs; Ontario’s electricity system
and generation capacity; and electricity demand forecasts as well as plans to balance the electricity
system, while limiting investment in additional infrastructure.

4.3.1

Governance, Regulatory, and Management Framework

4.3.1.1 The Ministry of Energy117
The Ministry of Energy (the Ministry) facilitates the development of Ontario’s electricity generation,
transmission and other energy related facilities. One of the Ministry’s top priorities is ensuring that
Ontario’s energy needs are met in a sustainable manner.
The mandate letter from the Premier to the Ontario Minister of Energy (the Minister), dated
23 September 2016, outlines the Minister’s priorities, including:


Taking further action to mitigate the impact of electricity prices on consumers and businesses,
partly through expanding eligibility for the Industrial Conservation Initiative (ICI).



Promoting energy conservation and the adoption of renewable energy.



Supporting the growth of the low-carbon economy and reductions in GHG emissions.



Driving efficiencies and maximizing return on investment from the electricity sector.

If successful, these actions will drive efficiencies, lead to an increasing reliance on renewable energy
and encourage greater levels of energy conservation, thereby reducing electricity demand in lieu of
increasing supply.

4.3.1.2 The Ontario Energy Board118
The Ontario Energy Board (OEB) is Ontario’s independent energy regulator, whose goal is to ensure
the energy system remains sustainable and reliable, and that the energy rights of Ontarians are
protected. The OEB’s mandate and authority come from the Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998; the
Electricity Act, 1998; and other provincial statutes, including the Energy Consumer Protection Act,
2010.
The OEB:


Sets rules for energy companies operating in Ontario



Establishes energy rates



Licenses energy companies



Monitors the wholesale electricity market and energy companies



Develops new energy policies in partnership with the Ministry



Advises the Government of Ontario on energy policy

The OEB assisted the government in the development of the regulatory framework for Ontario’s cap
and trade program, and is also in the process of implementing a five-point plan to redesign electricity
prices (OEB, 2012-2017a).

4.3.1.3 The National Energy Board119
The National Energy Board (NEB) is a federal body that, amongst other things, regulates the construction
and operation of international and designated interprovincial power lines, as well as the import of
electricity. The NEB also authorizes and regulates energy trade through long-term licences, permits, and
short-term orders. The amount of electricity exported cannot exceed limits approved by the NEB.
In performing its duties, the NEB considers the impact of exports on adjacent provinces and fair market
access for Canadians. The NEB reports to Parliament through the Minister of Natural Resources.

4.3.1.4 The Independent Electricity System Operator120
The Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) manages Ontario’s electricity system, forecasts
the demand and supply of electricity to plan for the province’s future energy needs, promotes
conservation, and operates the wholesale electricity market.
The IESO was established through the Electricity Act in 1998 as a not-for-profit corporate entity.
Through amendments to the Electricity Act on January 1, 2015, the IESO was merged with the Ontario
Power Authority. Through legislation, the Ministry oversees the IESO, which is governed by a Board of
Directors that is appointed by the Province of Ontario. The IESO operates independently of all other
participants in the electricity market.
The IESO forecasts the Ontario’s current, short-term and long-term energy needs, and assesses the
adequacy and reliability of the integrated power system to ensure Ontarians have sustainable
solutions to meet energy needs now and in the future.

4.3.2

Ontario’s Electricity System

Ontario’s electricity system is made up by a network of generation, distribution and transmission
systems that supply electricity across the province (Figure 4-26). The network is part of a larger North
American system, through which Ontario’s network is connected to neighbouring provinces and states.

The electricity system is described in further detail in the sections that follow.

4.3.2.1 Generation
Electricity is the flow of electrical power or charge produced by converting energy into electrical power.
Energy sources may be renewable or non-renewable. The main sources of renewable energy include
solar, hydro, and wind energy.121 Non-renewable sources include fossil energy sources, such as coal,
oil, and natural gas. Nuclear energy, generated from uranium, is a nonrenewable, nonfossil energy
source.
Historically, Ontario relied heavily on
coal-fired generation. From 2005 to
2015, the province significantly
reduced the level of GHG emissions
from the electricity sector, as installed
coal-fired capacity was wound-down
and replaced with renewable and
natural gas-fired capacity. Ontario’s
electricity is presently generated from
wind, solar, bioenergy, hydro, nuclear
and natural gas-fired resources, with
approximately 90 percent of the
electricity being generated from nonfossil sources.

FIGURE 4-27 ONTARIO’S 2015 ENERGY PRODUCTION

The province’s electricity needs can
vary by as much as 10,000 MW in any
given day. The province’s diverse energy supply mix allows for the management of different resources
to perform different roles to meet its varying electricity needs. Baseload refers to the minimum
amount of electric power delivered or required over a given period of time at a steady rate. A
baseload plant is normally operated to take all or part of the minimum load of a system, and
consequently produces electricity at an effectively constant rate, and runs continuously122. Nuclear
power plants and “run-of-the-river” hydro facilities produce a constant and steady output of electricity

and are considered baseload generation. Natural gas facilities and hydro generators with reservoirs
for storage allow for variable output, as needed. Peaking generators are relied upon to meet the
peaks on the highest demand days, while intermediate generators work throughout the day, with
output adjusted as demand varies. Wind and solar facilities generate variable output, based on
weather conditions. They are highly flexible in respect of the ability to adjust output, subject to energy
availability, allowing for variable but controlled generation.
A key difference between traditional and variable generators is that traditional generators store their
primary energy source (for example, uranium, water or natural gas) onsite and convert it to energy as
needed. Variable generators on the other hand, can only produce energy when the primary source
(for example, wind or sunlight) is available. As such, the principle challenge with variable energy
sources is that they can regularly drive a mismatch between demand and supply.

Installed capacity refers to the maximum
possible output of electricity generators
installed within the province’s electricity
system. Actual electricity production may vary
based on the availability of energy sources
and direction from the IESO to adjust output
to efficiently meet energy needs.

FIGURE 4-28 ONTARIO’S 2016 INSTALLED CAPACITY

There is currently over 37,000 MW of installed
capacity within Ontario’s transmission system
and an additional 3,600 MW of generation
capacity within local distribution systems.
Nuclear and renewable sources represent
approximately 74 percent of the installed
capacity and natural gas sources account for
the remaining 26 percent. Actual production
levels are discussed in the section that follow.
Energy Sources

Nuclear
Nuclear energy, generated by splitting uranium atoms, is a non-renewable source of energy. Nuclear
generation is, however, considered sustainable, given significant uranium resources relative to the
rate of use, and the low environmental impact of its use. Nuclear power accounts for approximately
58 percent of the province’s electricity production. There are three nuclear plants, Bruce, Darlington
and Pickering, with 18 generating units in operation within the province.

Hydroelectric
Hydroelectric (or hydro) energy is generated by converting the kinetic or potential energy of water
into electrical energy. Hydro generation is an important component of Ontario’s baseload and
peaking energy mix. Hydro currently accounts for roughly 23 percent of the province’s electricity
production, and is therefore the most significant source of renewable energy. Given the ability to
predict the level of hydro generation throughout any given day and across seasons, hydro is a stable
source of renewable energy.

Natural Gas and Oil
Thermal generating plants generate electricity by burning natural gas. They can quickly adjust output
based on changes in demand, thereby easily meeting peak demand needs or providing back up for
more volatile wind or solar generation. Natural gas is a fossil fuel, and generates GHGs as a byproduct of energy production. The volume of emissions is however, significantly lower than coal-fired
resources. Natural gas and oil now account for roughly 10 percent of the province’s electricity
production.

Wind, Solar, and Bioenergy
Wind, solar and bioenergy now accounts for roughly 9 percent of the province’s electricity
production. The contribution levels are largely attributed to wind energy, as significant government
incentives along with improvements in technology have resulted in greater output and lower unit
costs.
Wind energy generating potential is greatest in the winter and at night. Wind energy generators can
quickly adjust output in response to system requirements. Solar generation is important to Ontario’s

energy mix, with high production levels during the summer peaking hours. Bio energy is produced
either by combusting organic fuel (biomass) or by allowing organic matter to decompose, producing
CH4, which is then combusted to produce electricity. In Ontario, there are abundant sources of
organic matter as a by-product of forestry, agricultural and livestock, and food processing operations,
as well as from municipal waste. The key challenge to the establishment of bioenergy plants is
however, the high capital cost.

4.3.2.2 Transmission
Electricity is produced from generation plants and transmitted across Ontario’s transmission system at
high voltage before being stepped down to lower voltage for delivery to end-users. The province’s
high voltage transmission system consists of a network of transmission lines that are equal to or
greater than 50 kilovolts (kV).
The stability of Ontario’s electricity system depends on supply constantly meeting demand. The IESO
directs the flow of electricity across the grid, balancing demand and supply to ensure stability. Over
the past decade, the Province has focussed on maximizing the use of the existing transmission system.
Accordingly, significant renewable energy resources have been added without any major expansion
of the transmission network. The network is, however, nearing capacity, and now has limited ability to
accommodate additional generation.
Further constraints are presented when resource potential is not located within proximity to the grid,
as is the case for many of the Province’s untapped renewable energy sources. Significant new
transmission additions typically require a lead time of 7 to 9 years; therefore, the management of the
transmission system requires careful planning.
Capacity constraints lead to congestion in some areas. System congestion refers to instances during
the operation of the power system when there is not enough transmission capacity available to
accommodate scheduled generation. Over the long-term, transmission facilities are efficiently used
where there is a manageable level of congestion. In Ontario, as the use of existing assets is being
maximized, many parts of the system are frequently congested.
Current Grid Capacity
Ontario’s power transmission system is broken down into 10 zones, as reflected in Figure 4-29.

Supply and demand characteristics vary across each zone. As Table 4-26 demonstrates, in three
zones, Essa, Toronto and Ottawa, total resources tend to be lower than peak demand. In contrast,
supply in the Bruce and Niagara zones significantly exceed peak demand, largely due to the presence
of the Bruce nuclear generating plant and the Niagara Falls hydro facilities, respectively. In the
remaining zones, total resources either exceed or are balanced with peak demand.
