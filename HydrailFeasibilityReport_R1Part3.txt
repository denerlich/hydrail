follows:


Energy Input: To include LH2 as part of the Hydrail System, energy usage is increased by
10 percent, and energy cost is increased by 20 percent because—unlike electrolysis—the
liquefaction process is not readily interruptible and cannot focus on periods of low-cost grid
values.



Capital Cost: The cost of a liquefaction plant for the entire RER system is estimated at $160 million
This adds complexity to the supply chain and, with no evident substantial cost offsets, this is an
additional cost.



Distribution Cost: Centralization of LH2 would be preferred on economic grounds—the capital cost
of liquefaction plants does not scale well. That leads to a need for extensive distribution, and LH2
precludes gas distribution by pipeline. Admittedly, pipeline distribution may encounter some
public resistance, but is likely to be practicable. Trucking is cheaper with liquid than with gas, but
either, for almost any distance, is much more expensive than pipelining.



Problems with Solid Oxygen: Hydrogen needs extreme purification from oxygen before
liquefaction. Purification can be arranged, but it is a particularly significant issue with
electrolytically produced H2 with its inevitable initial oxygen content. This is much less of an issue
with steam-methane reforming (SMR) H2, which is generally oxygen-free. Traces of oxygen present
in hydrogen liquefaction can accumulate in lines and tanks as solid oxygen, and can lead to violent
detonation.



Accident Scenarios: In the event of a spill, LH2 does not disperse nearly as readily or quickly as H2
gas. This increases fire risks.



Hydrogen Losses: Design can curtail but will not eliminate H2 losses from boil-off within the entire
production and consumption chain, thereby increasing the operating cost.



Extra Handling Risk: While fast vehicle-fill times could be easier with LH2, it is considered more
prone to accidents than fuelling using the well-established technology for fuelling with CGH2.
Overall, LH2 is a much less familiar fuel than CGH2.

4.1.4.2 Storage Tank Characteristics
There is significant difference in the storage tank design in terms of materials, construction, and
capital costs. The design is primarily driven by the storage pressure requirements. For the transition
storage system, lower-pressure storage would save significant capital costs, as the volume of storage
is at least three times larger than the upcoming refuelling storage system. There are at least two
distinct types of tanks worth comparing (as summarized in Table 4-5) to provide a basis for the storage
system design.

Hydrogen Distribution Subsystem

The hydrogen distribution subsystem connects the storage system with the refuelling system, and it
differs based on gas or liquid phases of hydrogen. For the gas phase, distribution can be by either
pipeline or trucks; but for liquid phase, only trucking is possible for longer distances (beyond
1 kilometre [km] in length). Although for shorter distances (less than 1 km in length), pipeline is
feasible for the liquid phase.
The distribution system comprises the following equipment, shown on Figure 4-6:

4.1.5.1 Pipeline and Truck based Distribution
The distribution of hydrogen would only be required in the case of distributed production or
combined central production for various corridors. The current industry practice for gaseous fuel
distribution is either through pipeline or through tanker-trucks. They are chosen for few specific
reasons based on the parameters listed in Table 4-8.

The pipeline option could be selected if the production and storage systems are within the lengths of
the GO rail corridors to keep the capital costs at a reasonable level. Although the return on
investment would take longer than for trucks, but other advantages, including the higher reliability
and lower operational risk, strengthen the choice for the pipeline option. Additional information on
pipelines is available elsewhere82.
However, the reality of Hydrail implementation would occur in phases over a few years, so the first few
trains could go into service even before the full implementation of the Hydrail infrastructure if the rail
vehicles could be refuelled by trucks every day.
The truck option has another advantage in that it may not require the refuelling and dispensing
systems if the logistics of refuelling each train is planned accordingly. The trucks could be coordinated
to refill a small number of tanks near the dispensing point at higher pressure using a compressor for
the gaseous phase. If the trucks carry liquid hydrogen, they can be transferred to the train directly
without buffer refill storage, provided the train is storing hydrogen onboard as liquid. But in real train

operational experience, this arrangement would not work due to increased chances for accidents
(due to many numbers of moving pieces within the refuelling and maintenance facility) and impacts to
the reliability of daily operation.
This scenario of trucks refuelling the trains directly or through a small number of buffer tanks is not
currently considered in this study, as there are unknowns that do not yield sufficient and confident
information to assess the impact. There are two key unknowns: (1) the location of the refuelling
system, and (2) the number of trains that can be refuelled in parallel at these refuelling locations.

4.1.6

Hydrogen Refuelling Subsystem

The hydrogen refuelling subsystem is required to provide enough hydrogen for a full day of GO train
service, so the storage tanks are sized such that they can store up to 24 hours of gas – the volume of
gas required for 1 full day’s service for the RER Scenario 5 train service pattern. These tanks would be
located within the dispensing or refuelling facility where each train gets the required volume of
hydrogen for a full day’s service.
The refuelling system consists of the following equipment, as shown on Figure 4-7:


Compressors in a cascaded arrangement



Pressure regulator and gas distribution



Temperature control



Flow meters, valves, and sensors



Control system that distributes and manages electrical power



The temperature control is necessary during transfer of gaseous hydrogen onto refuelling tanks, as
hydrogen could cool down or warm up, depending on the pressures, during transfer from the
distribution system.

The design parameters for the refuelling system are similar to those for the storage system provided
in Table 4-4. The main difference within the refuelling system is for the gaseous phase, which is stored
at a higher-pressure range from 70 to 100 MPa. For the current Hydrail System, refuelling tanks are
designed to store the compressed gas at a pressure of 85 MPa, based on similar experience on
automotive refuelling system design83. This would provide enough pressure to fill the tanks onboard
the rail vehicles, which are designed to be at 70 MPa. The liquid storage is done in the same fashion
as it is done in the storage system.

The refrigeration plant is necessary during the transfer of gaseous hydrogen onto the onboard tanks,
as hydrogen warms up during its expansion from the higher pressure at the refuelling tanks into the
lower pressure of the onboard tanks.
For liquid hydrogen transfer between the refuelling tanks to the tank onboard the vehicle, the transfer
lines have to be maintained with good insulation such that the boil-off is minimized.

To achieve 15-minute fill times for each train, the gas flow rate currently existing for the hydrogen
vehicle application (at 432 kg/h or 7.2 kilograms per minute [kg/min]84) needs to be at least 4 to
5 times faster. This requires additional engineering design to split the flow into parallel manifolds. This
is helped by the design of the gas phase storage tanks onboard the vehicle where there are several
tanks. Simultaneous fill of multiple tanks using the parallel manifolds would enable faster fill rates
required to meet the 15-minute timeframe.

planned for the RER Scenario 5: (1) high-power locomotive (with 3 to 6 MW of peak power), and

The vehicle itself would have the power control system, traction motors, regenerative braking, and

There are two possible hydrogen storage options based on the physical phase: (1) gaseous hydrogen
at a pressure of about 70 MPa (700 bar) with operational pressure ranging from -20 to 30°C, and
(2) liquid hydrogen at atmospheric pressure and maintained at -253°C. The liquid hydrogen is twice
as dense as the gaseous hydrogen at that pressure.
FIGURE 4-9 HYDROGEN VEHICLE SYSTEM

4.1.8.1 Hydrogen Rail Vehicle: Platform
The powered vehicle (locomotive or powered EMU) design is at the core of the Hydrail System’s
design, providing the total energy required with hydrogen as the primary energy source. There are
three fundamental criteria that were used to design the Hydrail vehicle framework for this study:
1. Power Requirement: This dictates how much traction power is required for each powered vehicle
(delivered through several motors and axles as part of the vehicle platform). There are two
components of traction power:
a) Peak power: Determined by the acceleration required from each of the trains leaving a station
in the GO corridors. The acceleration requirement is not found in the IBC (Initial Business Case)
documentation as a specific number, usually defined as a speed to be achieved in a shortduration (km/h per second or m/s2). So, the basis for the peak power chosen for Hydrail is to
match the rated power of an equivalent electric locomotive or EMU considered for the IBC
model. Figure 4-10 shows the peak power requirement per locomotive based on the intended
acceleration. This shows that the faster acceleration requires significant peak power as well as
being proportional to the train weight.
b) Average or coasting power: Determined by the time allotted between each station as per the
train service plan for RER Scenario 5. There are additional parameters that impact the time and
the average power such as the number of signals; stops made along each journey; and
number of stations. So, an average of coasting power for all corridors was estimated by
CPG-PGM-RPT-245

analysing power profiles from simulation data for at least five GO corridors. This analysis
helped determine the average power requirement per corridor. The average power for this
study as a base-case was estimated at about 60 percent of the peak power.
The peak and average powers determine the total fuel required per train per trip. These power
parameters need to be estimated based on the actual requirement for GO RER Scenario 5, taking into
consideration all the associated changes that would need to be done to accommodate the desired
acceleration. For this study, the total hydrogen required is based on specified peak and average
powers from a known vehicle design available from a rail vehicle manufacturer. Any subsequent study
should pay attention to these two parameters as the starting point.

2. Weight Requirement: The peak power and the coasting or average power would also depend on
the total weight of the locomotive or EMUs. This depends on the train consist configuration with
the number of passenger bi-level coaches to be pulled at peak and off-peak hours. The difference
in peak power required is shown in Figure 4-10 for two train consists:
a) 1+6 consist: 1 locomotive (132 tonnes) with 6 bi-level coaches (294 tonnes) having passengers
in all seats (81 tonnes) for a total of 507 tonnes
b) 1+12 consist: 1 locomotive (132 tonnes) with 12 bi-level coaches (588 tonnes) having
passengers in all seats (162 tonnes) for a total of 882 tonnes
The train weight is directly related to the total energy required to move the train, so dictates the total
amount of fuel required for the train per trip. As an example, the fuel requirement during acceleration
for various train weights is shown in Figure 4-11 For proper comparison, all the fuel requirements

efficiencies for each of the propulsion technologies currently available – diesel (35 percent)86,
hydrogen (50 percent) and electricity (90 percent)87.
Given the significance of the train weight, the fuel savings pertaining to the 1+6 consist during offpeak hours (like EMUs) should be considered when estimating the lifetime costs for operation,
maintenance and replacement. In the current study, the fuel requirement is calculated based on peak
and average powers applied to the start-stop pattern for each corridor. But savings based on changes
in weights are not accounted due to the uncertainties involved, including the lack of a finalized vehicle
design.

3. Space Availability: To minimize the cost of redesign involved in a new rail vehicle platform, it was
decided to use the existing design from either electric or diesel vehicle platforms available in the
market. The available space onboard the vehicle platform was broken down into large blocks for
key equipment or human space (passenger seating in EMUs or cabin for engineers in
locomotives). Figure 4-12 shows the breakdown of space availability onboard the two vehicle
types providing the basis for fitting hydrogen equipment on an existing vehicle platform.

the vehicle is decelerating to respond to a slow/stop signal or to bring the train to a stop at a
station. From practical evaluation of energy flows in European rail operation, the regenerated
energy with respect to the total energy consumed is given in Table 4-10 in row 4 – “Energy
returned to catenary”. Remember that all the data given in this table is for electric locomotives with
overhead catenary system with the recovered energy directly fed into the grid.

The energy returned to grid as given in the table above suggests that there are energy losses incurred
in returning the recovered energy back into the grid, since there is no onboard energy storage
feature in these electric locomotives to use the recovered energy efficiently. The recovery can be
improved if energy storage capabilities are available, either onboard like in hydrogen-powered
locomotives and EMUs or wayside within the railway control. The recovered energy could be stored
and optimized for later use, and up to 30 percent of energy reduction can be realized, depending on

the vehicle speed, storage size and recuperation ratio89, 90. The efficiency of recovery (recuperation
ratio) could be improved if smart onboard power management systems (combination of batteries,
electronics and sophisticated software) are included in the vehicle design91.
The hydrogen equipment onboard was designed by first breaking down the space occupied by each
component from an existing locomotive or EMU design based on external dimensions from
manufacturer data. This was done in a very general manner, as actual dimensions were not available
for EMUs or for the right locomotive platform.
Then the space available for the hydrogen propulsion equipment was estimated by assessing the
primary components, such as fuel cells (includes power electronics and cooling system), batteries, and
storage tanks. The fuel cell and batteries were then sized based on the average and peak power
requirement of the vehicle platform (EMU or locomotive).
The storage tanks are designed to fill all the remaining usable space available on the vehicle.
Allowance is given to unusable space, including the corners, space between equipment,
passageways, external dimension of tanks, and support structures. This design approach helped
determine the actual number of trips that a train could provide, depending on the peak and average
power of the vehicle.
An onboard storage contingency is stipulated based on prior experience with diesel locomotives. Ten
percent of additional hydrogen was included in the vehicle design, so that there is additional fuel
onboard for unusual situations where a train would otherwise take longer to reach a station. This
contingency affects both the Hydrail System design and the vehicle design:


The Hydrail System is only trivially impacted by the requirement to generate this additional
hydrogen for initial fills and rare occasions when a train consumes this contingency hydrogen.



The vehicle design is affected via the additional space and weight required to carry this additional
10 of hydrogen each trip.

An optimum contingency value should be estimated for design of the Hydrail System and hydrogen
vehicle.

4.1.8.2 Hydrogen Rail Vehicle: Hydrogen Onboard Equipment
Based on the peak and average power required per train per corridor, the hydrogen components
onboard were designed to meet the power requirements. For example, batteries by themselves or
combined with ultracapacitors could provide the peak power needed during acceleration towards the
maximum allowable speed, so batteries were sized to provide the peak power required by the rail
vehicle – locomotive or EMU. The batteries were designed to retain about 70 percent of the state of
charge (SOC) to ensure recharging of the remaining 30 percent happens between stops per trip.
Fuel cells could provide power directly to the motors via the power management system, or they
could recharge the batteries on a continuous basis. In the latter, the batteries would then provide

4.1.8.3 Vehicle Fleet Mix Options
The Hydrail vehicle fleet could include the same combination of the powered multiple units or one or
two locomotives pulling the 12 bi-level coaches per RER Scenario 5. For Hydrail, a stronger case can
be made for two locomotives pulling 12 bi-level coaches in a push-pull configuration, as follows:


Splitting the peak power required by a single locomotive into two half-powered locomotives
enables storage of additional hydrogen onboard each of the two locomotives; thereby, increasing
the number of trips that these trains could provide in a day



During off-peak periods, the 2 locomotives with 12 coaches (2+12 consist) could be split with
1 locomotive with 6 coaches (1+6 consist) to provide the service, reducing hydrogen use



If the 1+6 consist is economical compared to the 4- or 8-car EMU, then the entire fleet mix would only
have locomotives, simplifying the O&M aspects of the GO rail network

4.1.8.4 Options for train service plans
The train service plan for RER Scenario 5 is one of the most important design bases for the Hydrail
System. This dictates how much hydrogen is to be generated. The key design parameter that
determines the total hydrogen required (in tonnes per day [tpd]) for the Hydrail System is the energy
(in megajoules or MJ) used by each train for a given trip across each of the GO rail corridors.
The energy required by each train in each of the GO rail corridors was assessed using the RER
Scenario 5 train service pattern. The energy estimates were based on the start-stop pattern by linking
the peak and average powers required by the rail vehicle with the journey time between each stop.
This energy was then converted into the amount of hydrogen required based on the efficiencies of
fuel cells onboard the vehicle and the electrolyzer within the hydrogen production subsystems. When
this estimate was developed for all the trains over a day in each corridor, it helped in determining the
total hydrogen required per corridor and for the entire GO rail network under Scenario 5.
If the start-stop pattern changes per corridor, say, due to the addition of stations or other signalrelated stops, the hydrogen required for each trip in that corridor would increase. The train service
plan is critical to the Hydrail infrastructure and vehicle design.
To show the difference of the effect of the service plan, the study compares the model results for two
timeframes in the RER Scenario 5 deployment: (1) 2024 as the beginning of the Hydrail train service;
and (2) 2044 as the completion of the deployment of the Hydrail train service with all the additional
trains added since 2024. This would therefore require addition of hydrogen infrastructure to support
the addition of trains in a modular fashion as discussed earlier in the production and storage
subsystems design. Table 4-12 shows the impact of the difference in train service plans between the
two timeframes in terms of locomotives required, hydrogen production, and electricity required.

In the IBC, five RER scenarios were listed, of which Scenario 5 represents a partial electrification of the
GO network. However, Scenario 4 within the RER program involves electrification of the entire GO
network, assuming this could be done. This involves complete conversion of all diesel-powered
vehicles in the GO network with the RER train service plan. When the design basis for the Hydrail
System is applied to Scenario 4 using the service plan, the additional requirement for locomotives,
hydrogen and electricity increased to that shown in Table 4-13.

Note that in both tables above, the number of locomotives for Hydrail is twice the number of electric
locomotives. This is part of the Hydrail System vehicle design, where the peak power of the vehicle is
halved to accommodate hydrogen in two locomotives of identical power. This provides both range
and flexibility, the former ensuring enough hydrogen to provide a full day’s service, and the latter
allowing for efficient fleet operation between peak and off-peak hours of the day.

Hydrail System Operations and Maintenance

The objective of this section is to present performance and economic outcome data from the
simulated operation of the Hydrail System and its options.
The Operational Simulation Model contains a definition of how the Hydrail System would operate as a
functional railway. It then applies this functionality, in combination to the hydrogen technology subsystems, to a model of the Hydrail System.
Both the railway model and the Hydrail System model are sufficiently flexible to accommodate new
data and options but results from the current underpinning assumptions are presented in this section.
The operational design and the subsystem sizing of the Hydrail System (discussed in Section 4.2.2.2)
were developed using a spreadsheet model created specifically for this feasibility study by scientists
from the hydrogen research group at CNL92. It is called the Hydrail Operational Simulation Model. It
was used to generate hydrogen process results and feasibility level cost estimates for this report.
The results from the Hydrail Operational Simulation Model were then fed into Metrolinx’s IBC of the RER
Program. In this section, costs are reported before applying the financial model assumptions and
conditions to distinguish the change in costs per the system design or cost scenarios discussed later, so,
the costs here are different from those used in the Business Case modelling, described in Section 4.4.

Fuel Cells and Electrolyzer Maintenance and Lifetime
Extending the lifetime of PEM fuel cells has been a major objective of developers, and steady
progress has been made, as suggested by the upward curves shown on Figure 4-13. This is
representative of the PEM electrolyzers, as well, since they have similar internal components as fuel
cells, so would follow similar lifetime expectancies.

Currently, leading manufacturers of PEM fuel cells have demonstrated 30,000 hours of lifetime. To be
conservative, this study assumes 25,000 hours for the base or 2024-cost case. For this study, “lifetime”
is not to a point of failure, but the point when a gradual loss of conversion efficiency from hydrogen to
electricity has reached a level that justifies taking the cell out of service and refurbishing it. The
manufacturers confirm that lifetime should be calculated in terms of hours of full-power operation.
For GO trains, it would be conservative to assume 18 hours per day of operation and half of that time
equivalent to operation at full power (to discount periods of no acceleration, coasting, braking, and
being stationary). So, 25,000 hours translates in real-time to an interval between refurbishment of:
25000 x 24/18 x 1/0.5/8760 = 9.1 years
The relationship between fuel cell lifetime and operational life is summarized on Figure 4-14.

Refurbishment consists of disassembly, replacement of the cell’s central membrane, and reassembly.
Today, refurbishment is estimated to cost about 60 percent of the original cost, and this figure is used
in this study. This is a conservative assumption, since future refurbishment costs will likely be less than
60 percent of today’s cost because of the continuing decline in original equipment manufacturer
(OEM) costs for fuel cells.
If alkaline electrolyzers are used, maintenance requirements are insignificant, since this type of cell
operates for decades with an occasional need to remove accumulated carbonate sludge and makeup of caustic.
If PEM cells are used, their technology is to PEM fuel cells, so it is reasonable to assume that they will
match fuel cell characteristics and require refurbishment in the same way after 25,000 hours at the
nameplate-power rating. For example, if 2.8 times more cell capacity were installed than needed for
continuous hydrogen, and current density averaged 3.11 A/cm2 rather than a nameplate rating of
2.2 A/cm2, lifetime before refurbishment would be:
25,000 x 2.8 x 2.2/3.11 x 1/8,760 = 5.7 years
The relationship between electrolyzer lifetime and operational life is summarized on Figure 4-15.

Battery Maintenance and Lifetime
The lifetime of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is beyond the scope of a preliminary assessment because
their lifetimes are impacted by numerous factors that can be mitigated through design. The effects
include the following:


Pushing the battery to its limits at either the very-high or the very-low ends of its capacity shortens
life. Systems are usually designed to avoid these zones or even to work in a comparatively narrow
range, which could be thought of as a way of adding overcapacity.



High temperatures (above 30°C) shorten battery life, especially when the battery is fully charged.
Charging at low temperatures (below 0°C) shortens their life.



High rates of charge tend to shorten life. This is why integrating them with ultracapacitors can be
worthwhile, since the latter can accept very high rates of charge.

Storage Tank Maintenance and Lifetime
The 700-bar composite tanks for on-train storage of hydrogen have been assigned a lifetime of
5,500 pressure cycles in a study by Argonne National Laboratory93. While specifically for automotive
applications, the critical factor is the diameter of storage cylinders, and this will be effectively similar
for Hydrail. However, specifying 5,500 cycles is a very conservative assumption, since Comond et al.94
have shown that a tank can be designed to sustain 15,000 cycles. The lifetime of these tanks is
determined by flexing of the steel liner. At 15,000 cycles and 1 cycle per day, the lifetime is
40-50 years and comparable to the expected life of the Hydrail locomotive.
The same lifetime expectancy applies to the composite tank construction for the very high-pressure
tanks used to store hydrogen at refuelling locations.
Lower-pressure steel tanks for buffer storage to accommodate optimized operation of the
electrolyzers will experience lesser stresses and have even longer lifetimes.
In short, no provision for replacement of hydrogen tanks will be needed.
Compressor Maintenance and Lifetime
Compressors are rugged mechanical devices and should have indefinite lifetimes if properly
maintained. Exactly what maintenance will be required is impossible to define without specifications
of the equipment to be deployed. However, a detailed independent review for the U.S. National
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 95 recommends that the cost of ongoing maintenance would be
covered by adding one-third to the initial capital cost.

4.2.1.2 Railway Operations and Maintenance
Maintaining railway system availability is crucial to providing an efficient and competitive rail
operation. Availability can be defined as the probability that a system is operating properly when it is
requested for use, or the probability that a system is not failed or undergoing a repair action when it
needs to be used. Therefore, system reliability, which represents the probability of components, parts,
and systems to perform their required functions for a desired period of time without failure in
specified environments, is closely related to the availability of the same system. Reliability addresses
the probability that a system is not failed, but because availability is also driven by the probability that
a system is not undergoing a repair, it will also be a function of its maintainability.
Operations
The Hydrail system was designed to provide the same level of service (LOS), or same frequency of
service, to the same number of passengers as presently considered in RER Scenario 5. The Hydrail
service patterns considered are an exact match to the Electrification scenario, and the passenger
capacity in each train consist has also been extracted and copied. The result is that from an operations

point of view, the number of trains per day to provide the service, and the distance in train-kilometres
(km) travelled is exactly the same for both scenarios.
The RER model is also increasing the revenue service train-km travelled by 9.3 percent to consider all
nonrevenue train movements (including dispatching, rerouting trains for maintenance activities, and
run-in to layover facilities) that are required for proper operation. A conservative 10 percent allocation
has been considered in the Hydrail Simulation Operational Model, described in Section 4.2.2, to
account for nonrevenue train movements.
Mixed Fleet Operation
RER Scenario 5 is currently considering a fleet mix of bi-level coaches pushed or pulled by either a
diesel or an electric locomotive. For bidirectional operation, the last bi-level coach is a cab car, and to
provide accessibility, an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) coach is inserted in the consist. Consists
of 6, 8, or 12 coaches are considered to offer the required service patterns. Also considered in RER
Scenario 5 is the introduction of a new fleet of EMU consists of four or eight coaches.
Table 4-15 presents the composition of the fleet required to achieve the higher frequency and higher
performance considered in RER Scenario 5. Note that the Union Pearson (UP) Express is not presented
in this table because there is no modification of its actual service in the Electrification scenario 20-year
horizon between 2025-2045.

The Hydrail fleet mix can also be similar. Four and eight EMUs can find direct replacement with
hydrogen multiple units (HMUs). Nonpowered HMUs will carry 150 passengers each, like a standard
bi-level coach, while the powered HMUs passenger capacity has been reduced to 90 passengers to
allow space for traction powers and HFC components. Since each multiple unit consist is powered at
50 percent, the passenger carrying capacity is the same in the EMU or HMU configuration.
Each electric locomotive is replaced by 2 HFC locomotives; therefore, bi-level cab cars are no longer
required in a 12-coach consist to offer bidirectional functionality. A standard coach could be used
instead, which would offer slightly more seats for each consist. This difference in increased passenger
capacity has not been considered in this analysis.
For the alternative where diesel locomotives are also replaced with HFC locomotives, the same ratio is
used for the replacement. A 6-car consist is pushed and pulled with 1 HFC locomotive, while a 12-car

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

consist is equipped with 2 locomotives. These configurations provide higher acceleration
performance than the existing diesel configuration and also provide a better power to weight ratio.
Service patterns will also need to be adapted in the Lakeshore West corridors where an eight-car
consist is considered. A single HFC locomotive should be designed to efficiently move six coaches.
Therefore, the existing 8-car trains could be replaced by a different combination of either 6 or
12 coaches to offer the same or very similar number of seats.
As presented in Section 4.2.2.4, there is also an alternative where all EMUs have been replaced by
new HFC locomotives pulling standard, nonpowered BL coaches. The proposed replacement was
made on a passenger seats equivalent basis. Adaptation of the service patterns will be required to
complete the evaluation of this alternative, which is outside the scope of the present study.
EMUs could also be eliminated from the Electrification scenario and service offered with an electric
locomotive with three, four, six, or seven standard coaches, depending on the number of seats
required. The downside of this approach is that, since the locomotive was originally designed for
12-coach operation, it will be overpowered for a smaller consist. From that point of view, the HFC
locomotive is better sized for those smaller consist operations.
Although EMUs are more flexible to reconfigure from small to larger consist and offer better
acceleration performance, they also introduce additional complexity from an O&M standpoint. Since
diesel, electric, and EMUs will be operating on the same corridors, this better acceleration will
somehow be lost when creating the service timetable. The passenger waiting for a train at any station
should not have to remember that at a peak period, the train is an electric locomotive, while at other
times of the day, the line could be serviced by a diesel locomotive or an EMU. The passenger is more
interested in having a constant service, coming to his or her station every 15 minutes, for example,
than the specific performance characteristics of a given type of railway car crossing the station. For
that reason, although an EMU may be able to brake and accelerate faster from any station and recover
time lost during the operation, it will be limited by the slowest equipment running on the same
corridor.
Normally, multiple units (MUs) are used to introduce a new service, where the ridership is lower and it
is more cost-effective to have a distributed power approach than an over-powered locomotive pulling
three or four passenger coaches. This explains why a DMU was the selected technology for the
UP Express. With the increase of ridership, more coaches are added to provide the service and,
eventually, it becomes more economical to pull those coaches with centralized power or a
locomotive. The GO service has already been proven, and high ridership levels are a reality, making
the MUs less attractive economically. The existing diesel and electric locomotives considered so far
have been designed with the goal of pulling 12 coaches, somehow explaining why EMUs are also
considered. The proposed approach of designing a Hydrail locomotive for six coaches also makes the
EMUs less attractive. Fewer coaches simplifies the fleet mix and its O&M, and makes better use of the
existing BL coaches.
Dispatching
The dispatching operation, consisting of trains coming out of the layover facilities to gradually feed
the daily service activities, will be exactly the same for each scenario. Independently of the fleet mix
considered, each train will be prepped for service in a similar manner. Preconditioning of the
locomotives and passenger coaches will be performed using wayside power. Predeparture tests
could be slightly different, depending of the motive power being used, but should have no significant
effect on the dispatching timeline.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

Operating Range
Since the service patterns are the same, the only remaining difference between the number of trains
that need to be dispatched on any given day is the operating range associated with each technology.
Electric locomotives and EMUs do not have any operating range limitations; as long as the power
infrastructure operates normally, trains dispatched at the opening of the network could operate
throughout the day and clock up to 20 hours of revenue service operation.
Diesel locomotive daily hours of operation would be limited by their operating range, which is
proportional to the operating power profile and fuel-carrying capacity. For the present operation,
centered around a wave operating concept (all trains coming to Union station during AM peak period,
and returning wave during PM peak period), the diesel locomotives need to go to layover facilities
after the AM peak period until they are dispatched again in time for the PM peak periods. Based on
the current LOS, there is sufficient time to refuel the trains during that period; therefore, every train is
systematically refuelled every day, even if it only needs 1,500 litres (L) out of an 8,300-L tank. Diesel
locomotives are operating an average of 7-8 hours per day, way below their potential operating
range.
By 2025, the RER program will replace this wave operating concept and will provide a core network
that has a train every 15 minutes, all day, while outer parts of the network would be served every 30 or
60 minutes. The diesel trains operating under this new scenario will have extended operating hours
every day and will not necessarily be fuelled in the middle of the day. Nevertheless, because a full
tank of diesel provides close to 20 hours of normal operation, as long as all locomotives are fuelled
every day, the 2025 and beyond proposed plan can be achieved with the existing diesel locomotive
operating range. New Diesel-AC locomotives that will be purchased in the future should maintain this
range.
The HFC locomotives will likely have a shorter operating range than its diesel counterpart. A
combination of additional fuelling points at terminal stations and additional rolling stock equipment
may be required to erase the effect of this shorter operating range. Although additional rolling stock
may need to be dispatched daily, it does not automatically imply a larger fleet. It could be addressed
with fewer trains set aside for maintenance activities on any given day, which may be adequate given
that the level of maintenance required on HFC-related subsystems is expected to be less than for the
diesel equivalent. This could also me made possible by the potentially increased reliability level of
HFC over diesel engines.
Run-in Operations
Run-in operations, consisting of the gradual removal of a train in service during or at the end of the
day, when the LOS is reduced or the time to end the service, are also essentially the same for each
scenario. This statement is true if the time to recondition the trains at the end of the day is similar for
each motive power technology, there is enough time between removal of service until the next
dispatch cycle to carry all daily maintenance activities, or both.
The major daily maintenance activity that is different between each technology is the fuelling
requirement, which is covered in the following subsection. Although each technology has a different
cycle time for its fuelling activity, because it can be performed in parallel with other more timeconsuming servicing activities that must be done during that period of the day, there should be no
impact on the number of rolling stock required to prepare the trains for the next day.

Degraded Modes of Operation
Up to this point in the analysis, only the normal mode of operation has been considered. This section
provides a high-level comparison between the electrification and HFC scenarios under a degraded
mode of operation.
From a system point of view, some elements are identical between both technologies. For example,
the rail network and the train control and signalling system are the same, and potential failure of those
elements will have the same effect on the rolling stock equipment and overall service delivery.
Besides those elements, the rest of the systems are different.
Although the reliability associated with the infrastructure (power stations, switching stations,
transmission lines, overhead catenary system) essential to the proper operation of electric trains is
high and offers some level of redundancy, it does introduce an additional potential for interruption of
service. Notwithstanding the initial disruption effect to the existing system operation throughout the
construction period (which also requires raising overpasses and station roofs, and possibly
modification to the rail alignment), failure of any electrification infrastructure elements will create
service disruptions on at least part of the electrified network. Some of the failure modes could
introduce performance limitations to electric locomotives and EMUs, or completely stop the service in
the affected section of the rail network.
Another element that needs to be considered is the additional activities required to maintain this
mainline infrastructure. Although some of those activities may be done at night when the system is not
operational, some activities will need to be performed during the day and will impose speed
restrictions on the portion of the network where the maintenance is carried out.
Hydrail also has an infrastructure that needs to be operational and needs to be maintained to
produce, store, and distribute the hydrogen required for the trains to operate. Those elements are
also subject to some malfunctions or maintenance activities that will limit their operation. The main
difference is that the complete system is designed to offer at least 3 days’ of hydrogen storage for the
complete fleet of trains, providing more than enough time to perform the necessary system
investigation and repairs. Also, independently of the infrastructure design, it will always be possible,
although less practical, to proceed with a direct truck to train fuelling scheme, bypassing the
complete hydrogen-producing infrastructure if required.
Therefore, from an infrastructure point of view and considering the potential impact to the train
operation, Hydrail has an overall advantage over electrification. Can this infrastructure benefit also be
extended to the rolling stock equipment?
To answer this question, the first element to consider is the overall reliability comparison between
diesel, electric, and Hydrail locomotives. In recent locomotive design, the main difference within the
locomotive propulsion system is the main electricity source, since all locomotives use this primary
source to power AC propulsion drive systems.
A diesel locomotive will have a diesel engine, cooling system, fuel tank and fuel delivery system,
exhaust system, alternator, and associated controls to produce the primary power source. For an
electric locomotive, the power source is external; but it needs a pantograph, a transformer, and highvoltage switchgear to harness this external power to the drive system. The equipment required in an
electric locomotive is much simpler than its diesel counterpart, is inherently more reliable, and
provides a higher power to weigh ratio, leading to better performance. For a Hydrail locomotive, fuel
cells, cooling system, hydrogen tank and delivery system, batteries, and associated controls make up
the subsystems required to produce the primary source of energy. Although a Hydrail locomotive has
CPG-PGM-RPT-245

Revision B

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

yet to be designed, manufactured, and tested, based on the maturity level of all components required
to make such a locomotive, its reliability is also expected to be better than that of a diesel locomotive
and comparable to electric locomotive reliability. Because it needs to carry its own fuel, similar to a
diesel locomotive, a Hydrail locomotive will also not be as powerful as electric locomotive.
Nevertheless, besides its intrinsic reliability level, from a degraded mode operation point of view, the
Hydrail approach has two major advantages over competing technologies: (1) its redundancy when
operating a 12-coach consist because it has 2 locomotives instead of 1; and (2) its leap home
functionality, made possible from the onboard batteries.
The introduction of EMUs in the fleet mix will decrease the overall reliability of the passenger coaches.
At the same reliability level as the locomotive, because of the multiplication of systems in any given
consist, up to four propulsion systems in an eight-car EMU or HMU, the overall reliability will be lower.
This will be largely compensated by the inherent redundancy of this distributed power approach. For
example, losing one propulsion package in an 8-car EMU still maintains 75 percent of the traction
capability, reducing the normal operational characteristics, but also limiting the impact on overall
system performance.
The Hydrail system will also need to address a potential degraded mode of operation. Considering
that the rolling stock reliability should be similar to the electric option and better than the diesel
option, that it is not directly affected by power generation infrastructure potential failure modes, offers
some level of redundancy and leap home capability, it should offer a more reliable system. Extending
this approach and eventually replacing all diesel locomotives and eliminating the need for EMU,
Hydrail also represents a level of operational simplification that cannot be achieved with the
Electrification scenario.
Emergency and Rescue Operations
Although each system may have a different reliability level, a degraded mode of operation can
eventually require emergency or rescue operations to remove the nonworking rolling stock
equipment from the rail network.
If the electrification infrastructure fails, then rescue can only be achieved using compatible equipment
that is not electric. Depending on the extent of the infrastructure failure, more than one train could
need rescue from a diesel locomotive. The service could also be temporarily replaced by remaining
diesel equipment. The LOS and performance would then be slightly affected.
For the most likely equipment-related failures, compatibility between electric and diesel locomotives
should allow for appropriate emergency and rescue operation on the electrified portion of the
network, which would remain as it is today for the rest of the network. Hot standby trains will need to
be considered at strategic layover facilities in the network to provide proper operation during
recovery mode.
An extra level of complexity will be introduced with the fleet of MUs in the system. Because of the
different physical characteristics between locomotives and MUs, it is less likely that compatibility can
be achieved between those equipment types. Hot standby trains remain the appropriate response,
but this also means the need for two types of train on standby for rescue operations. This will need to
be evaluated considering the reliability of each equipment type.
The same concept should be used for Hydrail. Similar to the degraded mode of operation presented
in the previous section, based on Hydrail’s foreseen reliability level, redundancy, leap mode, and

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

equipment type rationalization, should reduce the frequency of emergency operations and simplify
the deployment of hot standby trains.
Maintenance
The maintenance of the rolling stock equipment can be associated to four main categories:
1. Daily
2. Progressive
3. Corrective
4. Overhaul
The first category includes all activities required daily to service each train coming back through run-in
operations to be ready for the next dispatching cycle. Cleaning of all passenger coaches, water and
waste management, cab cars and power car servicing (including top-up windshield wiper fluid, sand,
diesel fuel, and diesel fluid additive for Tier IV engines), and running predeparture tests are likely daily
maintenance activities.
Progressive maintenance activities are normally established around a 90-day cycle, when the
equipment needs to go into a maintenance facility to perform systematic inspection, detection, and
correction of emergent failures either before they occur or before they develop into major defects.
Based on equipment manufacturer recommendations, the progressive maintenance plan is generally
designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by replacing worn components before they
fail. Some activities need to be repeated every 90 days, while others may only need to be done at
180- or 270-day intervals or on a yearly basis; therefore, every 90-day inspection is slightly different
but normally requires that the equipment, locomotives, and passenger coaches be removed from
revenue service for 3 days.
The ideal progressive maintenance program would prevent all equipment failure before it occurs. In
practice, this cannot be achieved; therefore, there is always some unplanned maintenance activities or
corrective maintenance that need to be performed.
The last maintenance category that covers the heavy maintenance activities and overhaul is also a
planned maintenance activity. This time, the equipment is removed from service for an extended
period, where major subsystems maintenance is addressed. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
(HVAC); truck; diesel engine reconditioning; and mid-life interior component; replacements are a few
examples of activities performed as part of this category.
With the introduction of any new equipment or technology, the maintenance plan needs to be revised
to include this new equipment. As a result of this review, the cycle time, amount of materials and
human resources, required training, procedures, tools, and maintenance facilities will need to be
adjusted. Hydrail will not be an exception to this reality.
One of the important modifications to the daily maintenance activities is related to the fuelling, which
is covered in the next section. The other daily activities will remain essentially the same and are not
expected to modify the existing timeline. The progressive maintenance will also be modified and
simplified due to ending diesel-related subsystem maintenance. It is too early to determine if this
maintenance category for Hydrail trains could be shorter than the existing downtime for diesel trains.
Since this cycle is also driven by the passenger coach maintenance cycle, it may not be possible to
reduce the progressive maintenance cycle even if Hydrail locomotive maintenance activities take less
time. This will be reviewed more closely as part of the pilot locomotive design.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

Based on Hydrail’s expected reliability level, corrective maintenance activities should be positively
affected, especially after the technology has been proven in revenue service. Nevertheless, this
category of maintenance will still be required.
The heavy maintenance or overhaul activities will also be revised and are expected to be simplified.
The selection of the Hydrail system components will dictate the overhaul cycle. Fuel cell
reconditioning and batteries replacement will be covered in this maintenance category. It is expected
that it will take less time to perform those activities than for existing technology, but frequency may be
higher. The fuel cell meantime between overhaul is currently around 20,000 to 25,000 hours of
operation, which is probably around 3 years of operation, relatively short compared to diesel- and
electric-based technology. Batteries replacement will also drive the overhaul timeline. Proper sizing of
batteries during the design stage as a compromise between performance, weight, and state of charge
will influence this replacement activity. The future development of both fuel cells and batteries should
also improve the time between overhaul.
Infrastructure and Organizational Modifications Required
Table 4-16 presents the expected state of layover and maintenance facilities by the end of 2020. All
the sites presented in this table also allows for minor cleaning activities and minor defect repairs,
supported by local material and parts storage, except for Oshawa and Milton that do not have that
storage capacity. Based on an equivalent LOS, this study considers that the number of tracks at
layover and maintenance facilities will be the same between the electrification and Hydrail systems.
The capability at each facility is presently under review to verify it will also be adequate to support the
expand LOS in 2025. The results of this analysis will also need to be considered for Hydrail.
Once Hydrail is introduced, maintenance yard and layover facilities will not need to be modified to
include the overhead catenary system currently provisioned for in the Electrification scenario.
Although the current height of the maintenance facilities is sufficient to incorporate an overhead
catenary system, for safety reasons, the current plan did not include this building modification.
Instead, electric trains and EMUs will be pushed in and out of the maintenance facilities by an external
source, creating additional operation and limiting the throughput of the maintenance line.
Existing interior maintenance tracks are equipped with sensors and extraction fans to remove exhaust
from diesel locomotives. The same approach will be used for Hydrail locomotives. Different sensors
will be required to detect potential hydrogen leaks, which will trigger extraction fans. The size of the
fan should be sufficient but will need to be confirmed.
Wayside power is available is all maintenance facilities and most of the layover locations, per
Table 4-16. The Union Pearson (UP) Express service track and Oshawa station should be modified to
also offer wayside power. This is important to limit the hydrogen consumption during network
operation. For the same reasons, any side tracks at maintenance facilities, where the trains will preheated or preconditioned before revenue service, should be equipped with wayside power.
The maintenance facilities’ existing workforce will need to go through a new training program to work
around Hydrail and especially hydrogen-related components. There is already a specific certification
program that exists for this technology in Ontario, developed for other industries, that could easily be
adapted to the rail industry.
During the transition period, until the Hydrail system is fully deployed, it may beneficial to create a
specific organization within Metrolinx to concentrate their effort on the successful introduction and
maintenance of the specific Hydrail installation and workforce requirement.
