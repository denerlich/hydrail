This analysis shows that the cost of hydrogen production (which is represented as $ per kg of
hydrogen produced) is 20 percent lower in the Hydrail simulation model than the DOE model for the
following reasons:




Approximately half of the difference is driven by the indirect capital costs. The following cost
elements have not been captured in the Hydrail simulation model:


Site preparation cost



Permitting and legal costs

The remaining half is driven by financing costs and taxes associated with producing hydrogen that
are not currently captured in the Hydrail simulation model. These costs include:


Initial equity depreciable capital;



Cash for working capital reserve;



Debt interest;



Principal payment; and



Taxes.

Results of the Hydrail Modelling Exercise

The process discussed above outlines a systematic method for developing cost estimates. This
process was used to develop, refine, and understand the cost estimate for the Hydrail System and
how this estimate compares to the cost estimates for overhead electrification as presented in the 2014
IBC model.
The IBC analysis resulted in a BCR of 3.07 for overhead electrification (Scenario 5). The update to the
IBC model for Hydrail results in a BCR of 3.01 under the low-cost scenario and 2.65 under the highcost scenario. According to this analysis, the costs of Hydrail and overhead electrification appear to be
comparable in the low-cost scenario and the overall benefits continue to outweigh the costs of the
system in all scenarios.
Table 4-39 provides a high-level overview of the 60-year NPV costs and BCRs under the traditional
overhead, and low, and high scenarios for Hydrail.

Under both (D) and (E), initial capital (that is, capital spent during the construction or development
phase of RER) and ongoing capital (that is, capital spent once the RER program is operational) are
included as separate items. The intention is to illustrate the difference between overhead electrification
and Hydrail as it relates to the distribution of spending over the lifetime of the RER program.
When undertaking a like-for-like analysis through the IBC model, Hydrail shows a slight to moderate
disadvantage when compared to overhead electric. This suggests higher costs will be observed
throughout the life of the RER program. Under a low scenario the model shows only a small decline in
the BCR between when compared to the overhead electrification case. Conversely, if a costlier
scenario materializes (for example, electricity prices are higher in 2040 than expected), the outcome
could impact into reduced BCR for Hydrail. The sensitivity analysis suggests that there are three
factors that will have the most significant impact on cost. In order of importance these are: price of
electricity; lifespan of fuel cells; and cost of fuel cells. Given the potential impact on the final results,
these are the items where further analysis should focus.
It is important to emphasize that the costs contained throughout the models (including IBC) are not
intended to reflect the price to install and manage the system under a typical commercial
arrangement. Such information would only be clearly understood following a market sounding
exercise followed by a competitive procurement process.
Other Benefits of Hydrail
Other benefits of Hydrail (for example, establishing a hydrogen economy, local jobs) have been captured
by a separate modelling exercise within the feasibility study. The socio-economic study examines:


Employment and GDP benefits



A reduction in disruption related to the construction of an overhead system in a live rail corridor.



The potential to develop a 'hydrogen economy' in the province that could spur the deployment of
hydrogen for other applications.



Supporting deployment of hydrogen for commercial use in transportation (for example,
passenger vehicles, buses, commercial vehicle).



The opportunity to support development of hydrogen based energy storage systems, which will
facilitate the increased use of renewable energy in Ontario's electricity system w harness surplus
energy

4.4.7

Updates to the IBC

Metrolinx is currently in the process of updating the cost estimate for overhead electrification that was
developed as part of the IBC. As discussed earlier in this chapter, during early stages of a project, where
the design of a system is still in initial stages of development, large variability can be expected in cost
estimates. As more detailed design is completed, costs are better understood and, in many cases, rise as a
better understanding of the project often reveals costs not previously accounted for.
Based on the update to overhead electrification costs currently underway, it appears that costs for
overhead electrification will be higher than estimated in the IBC. The updated costs will not be
finalized until after the completion of the Hydrail feasibility study and, therefore, these updates are not
reflected in this analysis.
Based on the work currently ongoing to update the cost estimate for overhead electrification there is
an expectation that CAPEX and OPEX will be higher than envisioned in the IBC. Adjusting for these
higher costs, the BCR in the IBC could fall below 3.07, as is currently captured by the IBC model.

The estimated BCR for Hydrail may also change due to refinements in the technical model or changes
to electricity policies. As illustrated in Figure 4-45, further modelling work may result in greater
hydrogen required for the Hydrail System, which could result in increased capital and operating costs.
Consequently, the BCR would be reduced from 2.65 as currently estimated in the high-cost case. On
the other hand, an electricity policy change that results in lower electricity prices will improve the BCR
from 3.01 as currently estimated in the low-cost case.
It is however noted that any future electricity policy change that results in lower electricity prices could
also improve the BCR for the overhead electrification case.

Other Considerations

It is also important to note that there are several key considerations that are not captured by the IBC
analysis that are critical to the overall business case and a decision on the technology that should be
used to electrify the GO network. These considerations as discussed below include potential benefits
from Hydrail, areas where it is unclear whether there is a benefit or a risk, and risks associated with
deployment of Hydrail.
First, the IBC model work likely does not completely account for the value of the risk associated with
constructing an overhead electric system in a live rail corridor. Although an adjustment has been
made to the Productivity and Resource cost factor to reflect reduced complexity associated with the
construction of a Hydrail System, this adjustment likely does not fully capture the entire value of
avoided risk that would be inherent to installing an overhead contact system on a live rail corridor,
something that is rarely done in the rail industry.
Second, Hydrail may present an opportunity to more gradually deploy HFC-powered train sets and to
potentially achieve this roll out with little to no disruption to existing rail operations. RER service levels
are currently scheduled to begin in 2024 accordingly, this is when additional operating costs begin
and related benefits are expected to be realized. If Hydrail is deployed, commencement of RER
CPG-PGM-RPT-245

Revision B

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

services may not be binary as is the case for overhead electrification. As Hydrail vehicles are delivered
to Metrolinx, it may be possible to deploy these vehicles on a portion of the GO network before
bringing the entire system online. This could potentially allow RER benefits to be realized earlier than
would be the case through overhead electrification. While this phased roll-out could help to realize
additional benefits, it could also increase operational complexity as some lines would be operating at
significantly increased service levels and speeds that may be difficult to coordinate with slower routes
through Union Station. This potential benefit could also be negated because of the need to develop a
hydrogen supply chain across the GO network. Further analysis will need to be undertaken to
understand if there may be regulatory, safety, operational or commercial considerations that may
hinder ability to seamlessly deploy a mixed fleet of hydrogen and diesel train sets as is assumed in
making this statement.
Third, the IBC model work likely does not sufficiently capture the comparison between maintenance
requirements of the two systems. While in concept, maintenance of fuel cells can be done without
significant disruption, the entire maintenance regime for a Hydrail train is not fully understood. In
some cases, manufacturers may require that maintenance is undertaken by their own trained
workforce, or a workforce with certain credentials. This could introduce operational complexities if, for
example, different workers are needed to maintain various components of the hydrogen system. The
maintenance cycle may be further complicated by regulatory requirements associated with, for
example, replacement of tanks and how the system is safety tested after such events. Furthermore, the
amount of downtime associated with servicing Hydrail vehicles compared to traditional electric
vehicles is unknown. This could impact the configuration of maintenance facilities and the size of the
fleet. The key point is not that the costs will be higher, but that maintenance requirements will be
more complex and will require different processes to be followed, potential impacts on facilities and
fleet, and likely a higher skilled workforce. The specific nature of these differences is unknown and has
not been quantified through the IBC model.
Forth, it is reasonable to assume that accreditation requirements of those undertaking work on the
hydrogen related components of the trains will likely be more stringent than for those servicing
traditional electric vehicles. The potential for limited availability of technicians to service the Hydrail
System is not captured by the Hydrail System model. Specialized technicians will be required to
service Hydrail vehicles and this is expertise that does not currently exist in Ontario at the scale that
would be required. The lack of a skilled workforce could lead to higher costs at the outset as the
industry trains technicians. To meet demand, the Province of Ontario may need to invest in
educational programs to develop this skilled workforce. Development of a new work force has
potential long-term benefits for the Ontario economy. These benefits are discussed in Section 4.7 this
study. The key point is that the lack of a skilled workforce introduces risk to the deployment of Hydrail
that would need to be overcome to ensure a smooth transition into service.
Fifth, a significant potential benefit of Hydrail is the opportunity it presents to electrify more of the go
RER network than would otherwise be possible through overhead electrification. This includes
electrification of the outer areas of the network where overhead electrification would be cost
prohibitive, and also to electrify corridors that the IBC model assumes would continue to run diesel
service over the course of the 60 year RER program. Broader electrification could mean increased
ridership as services will be more frequent and faster and associated increases to the overall benefits
associated with the RER program. These benefits would be realized assuming agreements to operate
HFC-powered trains can be negotiated in areas of the GO network that are not owned by Metrolinx.
Sixth, while Hydrail related costs have been modelled, there is inherent uncertainty in such processes.
On one hand, it is difficult to predict the extent to which capital and operating costs could come down
in the future in light of a potential surge in establishing hydrogen economies globally. This would
CPG-PGM-RPT-245

174

Revision B

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

come through increased competition, more real-world cases of implementation, and likely more
research funding going into the technology. Similarly, it is very difficult to predict with accuracy the
impact Hydrail could have on future energy prices in Ontario. Modelling work that has been
undertaken is based on Ontario’s current energy outlook. It is well-understood that the outlook is
based on one scenario where disruptions like mass deployment of electrical vehicles or significant
downturns in the economy have not been assumed. As explained in Section 4.3, the load presented
by Hydrail could lead to an increase in the wholesale price of electricity during the periods electricity
is demanded by the Hydrail System. This will be the case if a situation arises where the availability of
surplus baseload significantly declines due to increased adoption of electric vehicles and potentially
increased use of electricity for home heating as is contemplated in Ontario’s Climate Change Action
Plan.
Seventh, Hydrail has the potential to be an anchor point for Ontario’s hydrogen economy. Lack of
infrastructure is regularly sited as the key barrier to wide spread adoption of hydrogen technologies.
The scale of Hydrail could provide that essential backbone that is needed to make hydrogen a viable
technology option for commercial and personal transportation and for other purposes. To make this a
reality, the hydrogen supply chain for Hydrail would likely need to be purposely designed and
procured to ensure the broader potential benefits are realized. If, as an example, the fuelling network
was purposely built for Hydrail, those broader benefits may be missed. Should a hydrogen supply
chain be established and anchored in a long-term agreement for the provision of a certain amount of
hydrogen to supply the Hydrail System, and that system also is used for other commercial
applications, the price could be significantly different. The Hydrail analysis does not capture the
potential benefits associated with such arrangements. Related to this point, Hydrail has the potential
to facilitate continued efforts to decarbonize Ontario’s electricity system and to support continued
installation of renewable energy production capabilities as it provides a storage medium that is not
currently available. As per above, this would require that the hydrogen supply chain is effectively
open for purposes broader than Hydrail.
Finally, it is very difficult to quantify the risk associated with deployment of Hydrail at the scale that
would be required to replace plans for overhead electrification. While all aspects associated with the
production, storage, dispensing and use of hydrogen in fuel cells has been proven internationally, it
has not been accomplished in a rail setting at anywhere near the scale being contemplated in Ontario
and it has yet to be tested on rail vehicles that are comparable in terms of size and weight to what
would be required to meet RER service levels as contemplated in the IBC.

4.4.9

Fiscal Analysis

I It is important to note that although the NPV of the cost of both systems appear to be similar, there
are significant differences in the timing of expenditures. For the overhead system, it is expected that
much of the capital cost will be incurred near the beginning of the project as the overhead contact
system is constructed. For Hydrail, however, the initial capital cost is expected to be lower but the
recurring CAPEX to refurbish or replace hydrogen equipment is expected to be higher than for the
overhead system.
The combined impact of capital investment and operating and maintenance costs (i.e., the fiscal
analysis) is analyzed in this section as separate operating and capital cost results that were presented
in the previous sections do not clearly show how the investment affects annual budgets. A fiscal
analysis has been completed with respect to the following four categories:


Amortized cost: annual amortization cost of capital assets. The effect of initial capital investment
will appear in the books under the amortized cost of investment. It is assumed that initial capital
investment for overhead electrification will be amortized linearly over 50 years (that is, from 2024

to 2074). Hydrail’s initial capital, however, will be depreciated at different rates depending on the
asset type. For instance, fuel cells have a significantly higher depreciation rate comparing to
storage tanks due to their shorter life span. Components of the Hydrail System were depreciated
at the rates shown in Table 4-40.

Cost of financing: annual cost of debt. It is assumed that the initial capital investment is fully
financed by debt. The debt is assumed to be issued at a rate of 3.5 percent annually, maturing in
30 years for both overhead electrification and Hydrail.



Operating cost: annual cost of electricity. As explained in Section 4.3, the volume and unit cost of
electricity was estimated using data provided by IESO and the Hydrail simulation model. The average
annual operating costs for the first 10 years of operation was then estimated for comparison.



Maintenance cost: annual maintenance cost. The maintenance cost for Hydrail was derived from
the Hydrail simulation model.

The result of the fiscal analysis is presented in Table 4-41. The difference between total annual costs of
overhead electrification and low- and high-cost Hydrail scenarios is also presented in Table 4-41.
Under the low-cost scenario, Hydrail would result in an average decrease of $31 million in
Government’s expenses over the first 10 years of operations. Under high-cost scenario, Hydrail would
result in an average increase of $55 million over the same operating period.

develop a final conclusion on the fiscal impact of the implementation of the overhead electric and
Hydrail systems.

4.4.10 Findings
The comparison between Hydrail and overhead electrification, as envisioned in the IBC, illustrates
based on the information available, that total capital and operating costs for Hydrail are either similar
more costly than overhead electrification. In both the low- and high-cost cases for Hydrail, total
operating costs are expected to be higher than for an overhead system, as estimated in 2014.
The higher capital cost for the Hydrail System is primarily driven by the requirement for more frequent
CAPEX required to replace the assets in the Hydrail System, due to the shorter lifespan of the assets.
In the low-cost scenario, the higher ongoing capital requirement is counter-balanced by lower initial
capital required in the Hydrail System.
Although an attempt has been made to understand and account for the variability in cost estimates
that is inherent at the feasibility-testing stage, it remains important to emphasize the uncertainty in
both the cost estimates for Hydrail and for overhead electrification. While the BCRs for Hydrail and
overhead electrification are similar, with overhead electrification showing only marginally lower costs
than Hydrail under the low-cost scenario, further design is required to advance the cost estimate of
both systems to allow for a complete picture of the cost difference.
The findings presented are based on NPV estimation. An attempt has been made to translate the
analysis into fiscal terms because the government’s decision-making depends heavily on the fiscal
impact of the project. As discussed in Section 4.4.9, the capital and operating costs of the Hydrail
System would result in an overall annual expense ranging between $129 million and $214 million in
the low- and high-cost scenarios, respectively. The variation between the scenarios is primarily driven
by the difference in amortized capital costs that results from higher unit costs and shorter life spans of
the Hydrail System equipment in the high-cost scenario. The annual operating cost also increases
materially as a result of higher cost of electricity considered in the high-cost scenario. This analysis
requires further review and confirmation by the Metrolinx finance team, at which time a comparison
between Hydrail and overhead electrification scenarios could be considered and the associated
impact on capital and operating costs that will be carried in the provincial fiscal plan can be assessed.

4.4.11 Next Steps
As discussed, a more detailed estimate for Hydrail should include costs like permitting and financing
costs, and would also include a more detailed analysis of risk and the risk-related costs; this will
provide a more accurate picture of the total costs of a Hydrail System. At the same time, work should
be completed to update the overhead electrification costs. The IBC was completed in 2014 and,
similar to the requirement for a more detailed assessment of Hydrail related costs, a more detailed
assessment of overhead electrification, based on a more current understanding of costs should be
conducted. This will allow for a more complete comparison of Hydrail and overhead electrification.
Additionally, the focus of the financial modelling process to-date has been the total cost of the Hydrail
and overhead electric systems. This does not represent the price of system to Metrolinx—further
modelling work should consider things like procurement and financing costs to help provide a more
accurate picture of the full financial impact of the development of either system.
Finally, a detailed investigation of the risks associated with both Hydrail and overhead electrification
technologies should be completed. This will contribute to the understanding of the true potential cost
of each project.

Environmental

The objective of this section is to provide a high-level comparative review of the potential impacts of
electrification and Hydrail scenarios. The seven scenarios included in the comparison are summarized
as follows:


Scenario 1, RER Scenario 5: Electric-powered and diesel-powered train fleet mix.



Scenario 2a: Hydrogen-powered and diesel-powered train mix, with hydrogen production and
storage facilities (five) located in industrial areas away from the five Hydrail corridors. Hydrogen
fuel (liquid hydrogen [LH2] or CGH2) would be transported by truck from the hydrogen storage
and production facilities to the dispensing and fuelling facilities located at existing railyards.



Scenario 2b: Hydrogen-powered and diesel-powered train mix, with hydrogen production and
storage facilities (five) located adjacent to each of the five Hydrail corridors. Hydrogen fuel (LH2 or
CGH2) would not require transportation to the existing railyards.



Scenario 2c: Hydrogen-powered and diesel-powered train mix, with hydrogen production and
storage facilities (five) located in industrial areas away from the five Hydrail corridors. Liquid
hydrogen would be transported by a 4-inch outside diameter (OD) steel pipeline from the
hydrogen storage and production facilities to the dispensing and fuelling facilities located at
existing railyards.



Scenario 3a: Full hydrogen-powered train fleet on seven corridors, with hydrogen production and
storage facilities (seven) located in industrial areas away from the rail corridors. Hydrogen fuel (LH2
or CGH2) would be transported by truck from the hydrogen storage and production facilities to
the dispensing and fuelling facilities located at existing railyards.



Scenario 3b: Full hydrogen-powered train fleet on seven corridors, with hydrogen production and
storage facilities (seven) located adjacent to each rail corridor. Hydrogen fuel (LH2 or CGH2) would
not require transportation to the existing railyards.



Scenario 3c: Full hydrogen-powered train fleet on seven corridors, with hydrogen production and
storage facilities (seven) located in industrial areas away from each rail corridor. Liquid hydrogen
would be transported by a 4-inch OD steel pipeline from the hydrogen storage and production
facilities to the dispensing and fuelling facilities located at existing railyards.

Evaluation Methodology

A reasoned argument evaluation methodology was used to compare technology scenarios.
Assessment criteria were selected to correspond with the 11 environmental factors identified in the
GO Rail Network Electrification Transit Project Assessment Process Final Environmental Project Report
(TPAP EPR)147. For each criterion, metrics were defined and environmental effects were assigned to
each of the seven scenarios based on available information. For each criterion, preference was
assigned to the scenarios based on the magnitude of potential or anticipated environmental effect. A
rationale for the preference determination was then provided for each criterion, and for the overall
assessment.

4.5.1.1 Assumptions
The scope of the assessment was based on Scenario 5 of the GO RER Initial Business Case148.
Assumptions from the TPAP EPR were carried over to this assessment and include:


Service levels for the year 2025 and all additional RER infrastructure modifications are already in
place.



Projects outside the scope of the TPAP EPR (for example, new tracks, grade separations, and new
GO stations) would be assessed separately.



Electrification or Hydrail infrastructure implementation is separate from the other planned works;
therefore, the assessment does not evaluate their impacts.



The diesel-Hydrail scenarios (2a-c) will maintain the same fleet mix of diesel and hydrogen trains
as RER Scenario 5 diesel and electric trains.



Implementation timeframes for Scenarios 2 and 3 will be the same as for Scenario 1, 2024.

Assumptions related to Hydrail and associated infrastructure include:


Under Scenario 2, the five rail corridors would be converted to Hydrail; and under Scenario 3, all
seven rail corridors would be converted to Hydrail.



Liquid and compressed hydrogen fuels will have similar impacts at the level of detail assessed.



Central production facilities will be located in existing industrial areas, potentially several
kilometres from each rail corridor, and would require transportation of hydrogen fuel to the
dispensing and refuelling facilities.



Local production and storage facilities will be constructed adjacent to the hydrogen fuel
dispensing and refuelling facility along each rail corridor.



Trucks or pipelines would be used to transport hydrogen fuel from central production and storage
facilities to dispensing and fuelling facilities.



For Scenarios 2a, b, and c, facility footprints for the five hydrogen production and storage facilities
and five dispensing and fuelling facilities will be a total of 10,841 square metres (m2). It was
assumed that liquid and compressed hydrogen facilities would have the same footprints.



For Scenarios 3a, b, and c, facility footprints for the seven hydrogen production and storage
facilities and seven dispensing and fuelling facilities will be a total of 15,144 m2. It was assumed
that liquid and compressed hydrogen facilities would have the same footprints.



Facility footprint assumptions for electrification were based on infrastructure footprints (five hydro
one-tap locations, five traction power substations [TPSs], five switching stations [SWSs], and six
paralleling stations [PSs]) provided in the TPAP EPR. Areas associated with gantries, feeder routes,
bridge modifications or replacements, paralleling barriers, and the overhead contact system were
not included in the facility footprint.



Hydrogen production and storage facilities will have storage for 3 days’ worth of hydrogen.



Hydrogen production facilities can be located in areas designated for industrial use and in visually
unobtrusive areas, and would not be located in sensitive natural habitats or in areas of high

archaeological potential. Facility locations were assumed to have impacts equivalent to those of
electrification facilities.


Electricity for hydrogen production would be sourced from Hydro One through an underground
connection to the facility.



Water for hydrogen production would be sourced from the local water mains.



Use of Hydrail vehicles can be scaled up on the corridors once the production and refuelling
facilities are operational.

Evaluation Results

The comparative evaluation is included in Table 4-42. This section presents a summary of the
preliminary evaluation results, limitations, and additional considerations for future assessment.

4.5.2.1 Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecosystems
For this criterion, Scenarios 2a and 2b are preferred, as they result in the smallest potential footprint
disturbance to vegetation and wildlife habitat, and will not require modifications to existing water
crossings. Scenario 3a and 3b are slightly less preferred, as the footprint of the required hydrogen
production facilities is slightly larger than required for hybrid diesel-hydrogen scenarios. Pipeline
options 2c and 3c may result in additional vegetation removals and watercourse crossings, making
these scenarios less desirable than the other Hydrail scenarios. Electrification is least preferred for this
criterion, as it requires significant right-of-way (ROW) clearing, footprint impacts associated with new
facilities, and construction of new infrastructure in proximity to watercourses, including Redside dace
habitat149.

4.5.2.2 Contaminated Soils and Groundwater
For this criterion, Scenarios 3b and 3c are preferred, as they eliminate the operation of diesel trains
and the requirement to transport hydrogen using diesel trucks. Scenario 2a is least preferred, as a
portion of the transit fleet remains diesel, and the central hydrogen production facility introduces a
requirement for 78 truck trips per day to transport hydrogen to the dispensing and fuelling facilities.

4.5.2.3 Built Heritage
From a built heritage perspective, all Hydrail scenarios avoid the requirement to modify heritage
properties, so are preferred. Scenario 1 is least preferred, as electrification requires modification of up
to 12 heritage properties (bridges).

4.5.2.4 Archaeology
From an archaeological perspective, Hydrail scenarios not involving pipeline construction (2a, 2b,
3a, 3b) are preferred, as they result in the least subsurface disturbance; therefore, they minimize
potential impacts to archaeological resources. Scenarios 2c and 3c are less preferred, as pipeline
construction increases potential to encounter archaeological resources. Electrification is least
preferred, as this scenario requires the most subsurface construction.

Revision B

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

4.5.2.5 Land Use
Impacts to land use are not anticipated under any scenario. It has been assumed that hydrogen
production facilities can be located in areas designated for industrial use.

4.5.2.6 Emissions
From an emissions perspective, the full Hydrail scenarios (3a, 3b, and 3c) are preferred, as they
eliminate diesel trains from the RER fleet mix and reduce GHG emissions regionally, leading to
improved local air quality. Hydrail Scenarios 2b and 2c, and electrification (Scenario 1) are less
preferred and are assumed to contribute comparable emissions, though less emissions than the
current diesel train fleet. While Hydrail may require up to 3 times more electricity than electrification,
hydrogen production can be carried out at periods of low grid demand, reducing reliance on fossil
fuel sources. Hydrail Scenario 2a is least preferred, as diesel trains remain part of the fleet mix, and the
central hydrogen production facility introduces the requirement for 78 additional truck trips per day.

4.5.2.7 Noise and Vibration
From a noise and vibration perspective, the full Hydrail scenarios (3a, 3b, and 3c) are preferred, as
they eliminate diesel locomotives from the fleet mix. Hydrail locomotives will not have mechanical
engines, reducing the noise produced by the train. Assuming the proportion of diesel trains is
consistent between Scenarios 1, 2a, 2b, and 2c, these scenarios are less preferred.
Significantly more effects from noise and vibration can be expected during construction of
electrification infrastructure along the rail corridors and at facilities. A comparison of impacts would
require additional siting information and construction methodology for electrification and Hydrail
scenarios.

4.5.2.8 Visual and Aesthetics
From a visual perspective, Hydrail scenarios featuring a central production facility, pipeline, or both
(2a, 2c, 3a, 3c) are preferred, as they do not require overhead infrastructure; and there is flexibility to
site production facilities in visually unobtrusive locations (such as in industrial areas). Scenarios 2b and
2c are less preferred, as it is assumed that localized production facilities may be located in highly
visible or residential areas. Electrification is least preferred due to the requirement for extensive
overhead infrastructure.

4.5.2.9 Utilities
From a utilities perspective, Hydrail scenarios not requiring pipeline installation (2a, 2b, 3a, 3c) are
preferred, as they avoid potential for utility conflicts within road and rail ROWs. Scenarios 2c and 3c
are less preferred, as pipeline installation increases the potential for utility conflicts. Electrification is
least preferred, as extensive infrastructure required within the ROW is expected to result in significant
utility conflicts.

4.5.2.10 Electromotive Force
According to the TPAP EPR150, electromotive force (EMF) impacts are not anticipated. No impacts are
anticipated under any Hydrail scenario.

4.5.2.11 Stormwater Management and Drainage
As existing stormwater infrastructure would not need to be modified or expanded to accommodate
Hydrail, all scenarios are equally preferred. Electrification is less preferred, as it requires modifications
to the existing stormwater management system.

Environmental Conclusions

4.5.3.1 Overall Assessment
Key Evaluation Criteria
From this assessment, the criteria with the greatest relevance from an environmental evaluation
perspective are:


Footprint impacts (both facility and ROW)



Impacts to built heritage structures



Emissions



Visual and aesthetic impacts

Preferred Scenarios
The full hydrogen-powered train fleet scenarios (3a, 3b, and 3c) are generally preferred, as they:


Eliminate the need for extensive ROW clearing (associated with electrification infrastructure)



Avoid impacts to heritage bridges (required under electrification to provide adequate clearance)



Remove diesel trains from the fleet mix (thereby, reducing emissions, noise, and vibration)



Present the ability to draw power from the grid during periods of low demand (reducing reliance
on fossil fuel generation)



Eliminate the need for extensive aboveground infrastructure with the potential to negatively
impact visual aesthetics in and adjacent to the corridor

Comparison between Preferred Scenarios
Within these alternatives, there are trade-offs to consider that will depend on the ability to mitigate
impacts through design. For example, if the pipeline scenario (3c) could be designed to avoid
impacts to vegetation, archaeological resources, and utilities, the residual environmental impacts
would be minimal. Similarly, if a hydrogen-powered truck fleet was used to deliver fuel to the
dispensing and refuelling facilities, the environmental effects of Scenarios 3a and 3b would be
comparable. Consideration of further information, when available, on the environmental factors
assessed and of additional environmental factors could change the overall preference described.
As electrification requires construction of significant above- and belowground infrastructure,
environmental effects are anticipated to vegetation aquatic and wildlife habitat, contaminated soils,
cultural heritage and archaeology, utilities, air quality, noise and vibration, and visual aesthetics.
While a significant improvement over existing conditions, the ongoing operation of diesel trains
under Scenarios 1, 2a, 2b, and 2c will result in increased emissions when compared to the full
hydrogen-powered train fleet scenarios. And while electrification requires less total electricity, there is
also less flexibility in the timing of grid production, resulting in a potential increase in fossil fuel
reliance.

Based on estimated sizes for PSs, SWSs, TPSs, and
tap sites, the area required for electrification
facilities is 31,104 m2. Additional footprint will be
required for gantries, feeder routes and duct
banks, OCS support structures, OCS maintenance
facilities, bridge replacements and modifications,
and parallel barriers.
Impact to Vegetation and Habitat
Tree removal and vegetation clearing will occur
within 7 m of the outermost electrified track
through construction and operation to provide
safety. Tree removal and vegetation clearing
may be required for infrastructure and facility
construction, and maintenance.
Construction activities may introduce invasive
species. Damage to trees not designated for
removal may occur during construction.
Disturbance to migratory bird nests may occur
during vegetation clearing or bridge
modifications. Temporary displacement of
wildlife or disturbance to SAR may occur during
construction.
Disturbance to Watercourses
There are no direct impacts to watercourses
anticipated as a result of the electrification project.
Potential indirect effects of the construction works
include siltation, introduction of contaminants into
the watercourse using industrial equipment, and
construction debris. Bridge works are
anticipated within Redside dace regulated habitat
at Fourteen Mile Creek, Little Rouge Creek,
Robinson Creek, Brice Creek, and Rouge River.

Total footprint for production,

approximately 10,841 m2.
Hydrogen production facilities

footprint for production,

approximately 15,144 m2.
Hydrogen production facilities
would require 49 percent of
the area needed for
electrification facilities.

Reasoning and Rationale

construction of 488 km
of 4-inch OD steel
pipeline. Effects could
be mitigated by
constructing the
pipeline in the existing
utility corridor or
transportation ROW,
where feasible.

From a natural
environment perspective,
Scenarios 2a and 2b are
preferred, as they result in
the smallest potential
footprint disturbance to
vegetation and wildlife
habitat, and will not require
modifications to existing
water crossings.
Scenarios 3a and 3b are
slightly less preferred, as
the footprint of the
required hydrogen
production facility is
slightly larger than that
required for hybrid dieselhydrogen scenarios.
Pipeline options 2c and 3c
may result in additional
vegetation removals and
watercourse crossings,
making these scenarios less
desirable than the other
Hydrail scenarios.
Electrification is least
preferred for this criterion,
as it requires significant
ROW clearing, footprint
impacts associated with new
facilities, and construction of
new infrastructure in

From a contaminated soils
perspective, Scenarios 3b

Hydrail Scenarios 2b and

requires 3 times more

production can be carried
out at periods of low grid
demand, reducing reliance
on fossil fuel sources.

increased electricity

may come from power plants

While hydrogen production will
require more electricity than
track electrification, as Hydrail's
use of electricity is
predominantly at times of low
grid demand, fewer CO2generating sources are
required to produce electricity.
Using the hourly generation mix
of the actual 2016 data, it was
calculated that Hydrail would
use less electricity from fossil
fuel sources, and cause less CO2
emissions than electrification.

Overall
Assessment

In general, key differentiators from an environmental perspective include footprint impacts (both facility and ROW), impacts to built heritage structures, emissions, and visual and aesthetic impacts. The full Hydrail scenarios (3a,
3b, and 3c) are generally preferred, as these scenarios eliminate the need for extensive ROW clearing, avoid impacts to heritage bridges, remove diesel trains from the fleet, present the ability to draw power from the grid
during periods of low demand (reducing reliance on fossil fuel generation), and eliminate the need for extensive aboveground infrastructure with the potential to negatively impact visual aesthetics in and adjacent to the
corridor. Within these alternatives, there are trade-offs to consider that will depend on the ability to mitigate impacts through design. For example, if the pipeline option could be designed to avoid impacts to vegetation,
archaeological resources, and utilities, the residual environmental impacts would be minimal.
As electrification requires significant physical construction of above- and belowground infrastructure, impacts are anticipated to vegetation and wildlife habitat, cultural heritage and archaeology, utilities, and visual aesthetics.
While a significant improvement over existing conditions, the ongoing operation of diesel trains under electrification will result in increased emissions when compared to the full Hydrail scenarios. And while electrification
requires less total electricity, there is less flexibility in the timing of grid production, resulting in an increased reliance on fossil fuels.

4.5.3.2 Evaluation Limitations
Limited information is available with respect to Hydrail at this early stage of assessment. To fully
account for the anticipated or potential environmental effects of Hydrail, infrastructure design and
impact assessment is required at a similar level of detail as has been completed for electrification. For
these reasons, this should be considered a preliminary high-level review to be used as a guide for
future assessment.

4.5.3.3 Additional Considerations
While the 11 environmental factors assessed in the TPAP EPR were considered in the Hydrail
comparison, additional factors could be considered during a more detailed assessment. Human
health considerations were not assessed due to a lack of available information, but should be
addressed. Climate change and the operational constraints of extreme weather should also be
considered when comparing electrification and Hydrail. Both weather extremes, high electricity
demand during extreme heat, and operations under extreme cold weather should be assessed.
Electricity sources were assumed to be from the current power supply sources, but future electricity
supply may be from more renewable sources. A comprehensive assessment of GHG emissions is
recommended to allow for a comparison of electrification and Hydrail151.
The amount of material to construct electrification and Hydrail infrastructure and the energy to
produce, transport, and dispose of that material could be evaluated in a comprehensive assessment
associated with the electrification and Hydrail scenarios. Large amounts of galvanized steel will be
required for construction of the electrification infrastructure, while different production impacts are
associated with lithium ion batteries. Waste management and recycling for all construction materials,
including lithium ion batteries, would also need to be considered. A review of plans for recycling
programs for automotive and other large-scale lithium ion batteries, and the capacity to support the
high numbers of spent batteries, should be completed.

Laws and Regulations Governing Metrolinx

The Ontario Metrolinx Act (2006) governs the structure of Metrolinx’s business. This act touches on
accountability and the applicability of the Canada Transportation Act. The act applies directly to public
and private railway systems. There is specific federal legislation covering railways that apply to
Metrolinx operations.
There are basic legal requirements under building, electrical, and fire codes on building infrastructure
that apply to Hydrail.
At the legislative level, there is nothing obvious that applies specifically to the use of hydrogen as fuel.
The references start to appear at the regulation level.

Before they could operate their current fleet, Metrolinx had to meet, amongst other requirements, the
Railway Operating Certificate Regulations (SOR/2014-258). To obtain this certificate, the operator
needs to have a safety management system that meets the requirements of the Railway Safety
Management System Regulations (SOR/2015-26). Under the Railway Safety Act, a railway operator
needs to submit a new Risk Assessment before the introduction of a new technology.

4.6.2

Existing Laws, Regulations, Standards, and Codes –
Hydrogen Facilities and Transportation

Hydrogen facility legal requirements, codes, and standards include:
1. CAN/BNQ 1784-000, Canadian Hydrogen Installation Code (2007, currently in review). This code
(commonly referred to as CHIC) is enforced in Ontario (through the Technical Standards and
Safety Authority [TSSA], Fuels division) and is intended to apply to most hydrogen equipment and
systems used for generation, dispensing, storage, and piping. The relevant exceptions are:


Industrial use (process feedstock) or production as by-product



Industrial production of more than 21 kilograms per hour (kg/h)



Liquid hydrogen production



Transportation of hydrogen, including pipelines



Hydrogen onboard vehicles (it is not clear, but inferred, that this includes trains)

For the full-scale deployment of Hydrail, this standard would not apply to the hydrogen
production plant, since the scale (2,000 kg/h) is much higher than the CHIC limit. However, CHIC
would likely apply to a pilot Hydrail project and to various parts of the full-scale project (in fuelling
depots). The CHIC remains as a preferred guide for any hydrogen installation in Canada, since it
has been developed by those experienced in all parts of the hydrogen industry.
2. CSA-B51 Part 1, General Requirements for Boilers, Pressure Vessels and Pressure Piping. This
standard applies to most systems where hydrogen is used or stored at gauge pressure greater
than 101 kiloPascals (kPa). However, it does not apply to cylinders for transportation of hydrogen
regulated by Transport Canada, onboard automotive vehicle hydrogen fuel storage, or refuelling
station pressure piping and ground storage systems.
3. CSA-B51 Part 3, Compressed Natural Gas and Hydrogen Refuelling Station Pressure Piping
Systems and Ground Storage Vessels. This standard covers pressure piping systems with design
pressures greater than 414 kPa (gauge) used in hydrogen refuelling stations and local hydrogen
storage vessels for refuelling stations. This was not intended to apply to trains, though trains are
not specifically excluded and should be relevant, though the size of train systems would be
expected to be much larger than for automobiles or buses.
4. CSA-C22.1, Canadian Electric Code, Part 1. This safety standard provides requirements for
installation of electrical equipment. It does not apply to systems that supply motive power to trains
or are used for railway communications. Of particular note is Section 18 that deals with hazardous
locations where electrical equipment and hydrogen may be present at quantities greater than its
lower flammability limit. A prescribed method for determination of the area classification is not
included in the Canadian Electrical Code, but informative recommendations are provided in
Appendix L. The prescriptive standard from the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC),
IEC-60079-10-1, Explosive Atmospheres - Part 10-1: Classification of Areas - Explosive Gas
Atmospheres, is the main reference used for area classification.

5. ISO 22734-1, Hydrogen generators using water electrolysis process - Part 1: Industrial and
commercial applications. This international standard applies to caustic and solid polymer
electrolyte types, regardless of size. It provides a standard for certification of electrolysis systems
for safety and performance.
6. ISO/TS 19880-1, Gaseous hydrogen — Fueling stations — Part 1: General requirements. This is the
first of a series of international standards (there are parts 1 to 8) specifying requirements and
recommendations for hydrogen fuelling stations for light-duty land vehicles. It particularly notes
that it is suitable guidance for fuelling stations for larger vehicles (buses and trams, though trains
are not noted). The other parts of 19880 cover specialized equipment required in a fuel dispenser
(for example, nozzles). Some discussion of SAE International (SAE) J2601, Fueling Protocols for
Light Duty Gaseous Hydrogen Surface Vehicles, requirements is also presented.
7. ANSI/CSA HGV 4.1, Standard for hydrogen dispensing systems. This North American standard
applies directly to general requirements for integrated automobile hydrogen dispensers. Others
in this series (HGV 4.1-4.8 and 4.10) cover parts of the dispenser system and operation. HGV 4.9
deals with design, installation, and O&M of hydrogen fuelling stations for automobiles. These are
all suitable as some guidance for train hydrogen fuel dispensing systems.
8. CGA G-5.5, Hydrogen Vent Systems: This North American standard is for the safe design of
hydrogen vent systems (required to be pressure systems by CHIC).
9. ISO 14687, Hydrogen fuel quality – Product specification. This international standard specifies the
minimum quality characteristics of hydrogen fuel, including use in fuel cells.
Containers and Transportation of Hydrogen (UN1049 – gas, UN1966 – liquid)
Hydrogen container and transportation requirements, codes, and standards include:
1. SOR 2017-137, Consolidated Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations. This act covers
requirements for transportation of hydrogen by road and rail.
2. TP 14877E, Containers for the Transportation of Dangerous Goods by Rail. This Canadian standard
provides the minimum requirements regarding the design, manufacture, qualification, selection,
and use, or testing, of containers for transportation by rail. It applies to compressed gas or liquid
hydrogen.
3. CSA B620-14, Highway tanks and TC transportable tanks for transportation of dangerous goods.
This Canadian standard is used in conjunction with Canadian transportation of dangerous goods
regulations to cover design, fabrication, use, and maintenance of containers transportable by
road. It (along with CSA B621, Selection and use of highway tanks, TC portable tanks, and other
large containers for the transportation of dangerous goods, Classes 3, 4, 5, 6.1, 8, and 9; and B622,
Selection and use of highway tanks, TC portable tanks, and ton containers for the transportation of
dangerous goods, Class 2) applies to compressed gas and liquid hydrogen in all types of
acceptable tanks.
4. CGA G-5, Hydrogen. This well-established North American standard covers hydrogen container
design, and safe storage and handling of containers for compressed gas and liquid.
5. CSA Z662-15, Oil and gas pipeline systems. This Canadian standard extensively covers pipelines
for conveying natural gas, but does not address pipelines specifically for hydrogen.

Hydrogen-powered Locomotion
Hydrogen-powered locomotion legal requirements, codes, and standards include:
1. SAE J2578, Recommended Practice for General Fuel Cell Vehicle Safety. This document relates to
the overall design, construction, and O&M of FCVs. It is intended for automobiles, but relevant for
trains.
2. CSA-B51 Part 2, High-pressure Cylinders for the Onboard Storage of Natural Gas and Hydrogen as
Fuels for Automotive Vehicles. This standard covers only metal, metal-lined, and composite
cylinders between 20 and 1000 litres (L) in capacity used for onboard automotive fuel storage. It
does not appear to apply to trains.
3. IEC 62282-2, Fuel cell technologies - Part 2: Fuel cell modules. This international standard covers
all types of fuel cells of any size, but excludes fuel cells on vehicles. While not stated directly, it
appears to also exclude fuel cells on trains. Part 3 of this standard is for stationary fuel cells, and
Part 4 is for industrial trucks (that is, forklifts).
North American standards have been developed for fuel-cell powered vehicles but are limited to
light-duty vehicles, including automobiles, small trucks, and forklifts. These include:
1. ANSI HGV 3.1, Fuel System Components for Compressed Hydrogen Powered Vehicles
2. ANSI-CSA HPRD 1, Thermally Activated Pressure Relief Devices for Hydrogen Vehicle Fuel

4.6.3

Other Existing Laws, Regulations, Standards, and Codes
Relevant to Hydrail

There are many existing rail transportation regulations, codes, and standards to cover aspects other
than the driving energy source. To supplement the regulations, codes, and standards presented in
the previous section, there are some additional general codes and standards for hydrogen, including:
1. NFPA-2, Hydrogen Technologies Code. This code applies to American hydrogen installations and
has fewer exceptions than CHIC (particularly for industrial installations), but does exempt onboard
vehicle systems. It is prescriptive, but with disclaimers allowing authority having jurisdiction (AHJ)
discretion. It clearly applies to the fire safety of fixed, transportable, and mobile hydrogen systems.
2. ISO-TR 15916, Basic Considerations for the Safety of Hydrogen Systems. This international
standard provides a comprehensive review of principles for safe design and use of hydrogen in
systems.
3. NFPA-55, Compressed Gases and Cryogenics Fluids Code. This United States (U.S.) code is wellaccepted for guidance on the fire-safety aspects of design and use of compressed gas and liquid
hydrogen systems and containers.
Web-based resources for hydrogen safety are also available. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
hosts websites with information about OPEX and background safety resources, including:
1. Hydrogen Tools, https://h2tools.org/: Developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory with
funding from the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy's Fuel Cell Technologies

How Existing Regulations Might Need to Change for Hydrail

The Hydrail System can be logically divided up in two ways—either by step in the sequence of
production to use, or by process type. For this discussion, the steps are:
1. Hydrogen Production: This step is assumed to be a single, large-scale, industrial water electrolysis
plant. The electrolysis equipment would be expected to comply with ISO-22734. The plant would
not fall under CHIC, but would follow the normal industrial practice of meeting building codes,
and process vessel and piping codes. As well, hydrogen system engineering expertise would be
fully involved in the project. The design would be proven to be safe to the satisfaction of the AHJ,
often with reference to first principles. No change to codes and standards appears to be needed
in this step.
2. Hydrogen Storage (Production Site): Existing codes and standards (B51 Part 1 and CGA G-5)
adequately cover this.
3. Hydrogen Distribution: Transport Canada regulations and codes adequately cover this, both for
gas and liquid by road and rail. Pipeline distribution is regulated in Ontario by the Ontario Energy
Board, with TSSA responsible for review and inspection according to CSA Group (CSA) codes and
standards (Z662). This is expected to need revision to adequately cover hydrogen, though there
are already approved and operating hydrogen pipelines in Canada (for example, Heartland in
Alberta).
4. Hydrogen Refill (local storage at refuelling site): The existing codes that address refuelling station
storage systems are directed towards public-access automobile refuelling. The rail system
refuelling will differ in several ways. It will be much larger, single-purpose, within a controlled area,
and operated by trained staff. The existing standards (B51 Part 3, ISO/TS 19880) should be able to
be modified for rail. However, B51 Part 1, CGA G-5, and NFPA-2 are also applicable and could be
adequate for this purpose.
5. Hydrogen Dispensing (Refuelling): Requirements for dispensing are not well-defined at this point.
It is expected that the transfer rates will be high compared with those for existing systems based
on automobiles. New equipment and codes (that is, the HGV 4 series) may be needed. For
dispensing liquid hydrogen, existing industrial methods and equipment should be applicable.
6. Hydrogen Vehicle (onboard use of hydrogen): The codes and standards noted in this section
address all the types of systems required for Hydrail locomotives, but only for automobiles and
forklifts. For trains, there is not only a significant change in the size and quantities involved, but the
situation is different because the operation is controlled by trained staff, and the travel is restricted
to dedicated areas. Incorporating allowance for trains into the standards for road vehicles may not
be practical, and new standards may need to be developed. This step in the Hydrail sequence
provides the most complex situation with the most diverse scenarios for safety analysis.

Need for Additional Laws, Regulations, Standards, and
Codes specifically for Hydrail

An overview of the existing regulations, codes, and standards relevant to the use of hydrogen on
passenger trains, as well as the generation, storage, and transportation of hydrogen, has identified
the following for each Hydrail system component:


For hydrogen production, no change to codes and standards appears to be needed.



For hydrogen storage, existing codes and standards are adequate.



For hydrogen distribution, revision to the codes and standards for pipelines may be required.



For hydrogen refill, the existing codes (B51 Part 3, ISO/TS 19880) that address refuelling stations
for automobiles should be modified for rail applications, but the codes (B51 Part 1, CGA G-5, and
NFPA-2) are also applicable and could be adequate for rail.



For hydrogen dispensing, requirements are not well-defined, so new equipment and codes (for
example, the HGV 4 series) may be needed. For dispensing liquid hydrogen, existing industrial
protocols and equipment should be applicable.



For hydrogen vehicles, incorporating allowance for trains into the standards for road vehicles may
not be practical, and new standards may need to be developed.

Proposed Roadmap

To create a comprehensive regulatory framework for Hydrail, the following steps are proposed:
1. Engage a group of hydrogen and rail safety experts to work with Metrolinx.
2. Review Metrolinx’s existing safety management system (for example, programs, procedures,
protocols, training, work activities) to highlight any modification required for Hydrail.
3. Review Transport Canada regulations and standards, CSA codes and standards, U.S. standards,
and ISO standards. Prioritize these codes and standards in terms of applicability to Hydrail.
4. Engage ISO TC197 and CSA working groups to develop new or modify existing codes and
standards specifically for Hydrail.
5. Seek public input and feedback.
6. Preparation and submission of Safety Case for approval by Transport Canada.
