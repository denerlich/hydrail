Ohio, which has a program for Fuel Cell
Technology. Further, colleges in Canada have
recently facilitated forums or meetings related to
hydrogen fuel technology, including Canadore
College in North Bay, Ontario and Red River
College in Manitoba.
Partnerships and funding (public and private) to
support skills training in this industry is crucial to
ensure the skills and abilities exist for an initiative
as large as Hydrail on the GO network.

General - Regulatory

The CHIC falls under the TSSA; however,
this regulatory framework does not seem to
accommodate hydrogen powered trains on
a large scale. Without an adequate
regulatory framework, it will be difficult for
companies to assume risk on this type of
venture.

Engagement with Transport Canada is believed
to be underway with CNL providing advice on
safety and other related factors. Currently, there
is no regulatory framework in place for hydrogen
powered trains and the timeline is unclear. A plan
of action, including for required consultations
and engagement with involved agencies, should
be developed and actioned.
There have been licences granted in Canada for
hydrogen powered equipment, including forklifts
and vehicles (e.g., buses). This will provide a
baseline for future work in the area.

4.10.5 Hydrail Rolling Stock, Operations and Maintenance of Rolling
Stock and Related Maintenance Facilities
The Ontario Ministry of Transportation and Metrolinx recently issued an RFP to allow various rail
vehicle manufacturers to develop designs and determine the overall impacts on the addition of fuel
cell technology on BL trains. The focus of this procurement was on how this relatively new technology
may impact the overall RER business case, service delivery and ultimately the performance of the GO
network. Responses have recently been received and are being evaluated by government officials.
The results of this process, which are still unknown, are expected to lead into the planning of an
integrated DBFOM procurement should Hydrail be considered a potential technical solution for the
RER Strategy.
Although the results of this process may add clarity to what options exist for rolling stock, there are
other commercial considerations as well. These are explored further below.

4.10.5.1 Business Factors
Hydrogen powered vehicles are a relatively new concept compared to other traditional methods,
primarily fossil-fuel (that is, diesel) public transportation vehicles. Though on a relatively small scale,
there are many examples of the application in buses, particularly in Europe and in California. Also,
current plans are being implemented in Japan for over 100 Toyota hydrogen powered buses for the
Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. There are no examples of hydrogen fuelled trains in commercial
operation.
Aside from the current state of business for hydrogen powered vehicles, there are other specific
considerations that should be addressed as Hydrail is contemplated for the GO network (Table 4-51).

Factor for Consideration

Potential Steps/Options

Hydrogen Vehicle

Lack of competition for the manufacturing,
operations and maintenance of hydrogen
powered trains could leave government in a
difficult business position. Depending on the
structure of related procurement processes,
this could lead to limited competition and price
or quality risk for government.
Based on research completed to date, Alstom
is the only company advanced in the
manufacturing of HFC passenger trains,
although Siemens recently announced a train
development agreement with fuel cell
company, Ballard. Further, Alstom’s current
hydrogen powered rolling stock is in the pilot
project stage, has not been proven for widescale use and is a different train set compared
to requirements planned to date for Metrolinx.
It is also important to note that European rail
manufacturers Alstom and Siemens have
announced intentions to merge operations. It is
unclear what this means for the hydrogen
powered train program in Germany.

Hydrail pilot projects could be possible on
sections of the GO network that are more difficult
for overhead electrification (should electrification
be chosen as the preferred option). Ideally, this
would occur once existing diesel locomotives are
nearing the end of their useful lives. This might
include Milton and Richmond Hill sections due to
physical restrictions and potential environmental
and stakeholder concerns.
This approach would allow for a phased-in
approach to hydrogen powered rail and also lead
to a more organic development of the related
industry in Canada on a larger scale than currently
exists.
If Hydrail is chosen as either a potential or
preferred model for the entire GO network, some
or all of these risks may be able to be transferred
to a private partner(s), depending on the
procurement model chosen. A market sounding
would be required to determine what may be
acceptable to industry. Also, depending on the
results of the recent RFP issued, which asked rail
vehicle manufacturers to develop Hydrail options,
these risks may be mitigated.

Timing of
Hydrogen Vehicle
Introduction

Useful life still exists on existing diesel
locomotives in the GO fleet and it is planned
that any private partner would assume
responsibility for these locomotives

Opportunity to phase-in a new approach (e.g.,
electrification or Hydrail) may be considered so
that priority segments are completed in early
phases and lesser priorities are completed in the
future. This will allow for lessons learned to be
applied on future phases. The structuring of
procurement may still allow for one consortium to
complete all phases or for phases to be split up to
allow for increased competitive tension in the
market.

Hydrogen Vehicle
Operations

To ensure that Metrolinx operations are not
interrupted, a constant, uninterrupted fuel
supply is required by the vehicle operator. It is
unlikely that there will be another hydrogen
fuel provider outside of this initiative that will be
able to provide the large scale of fuel required
daily to ensure no loss of service.

Control for on-site hydrogen storage, dispensing
and refuelling may be best placed at the operator
level; however, there would still not be a
guarantee that interface risk won’t occur. A plan
for redundancy in the case that hydrogen fuel not
be available should be developed.

The East Rail and Eglinton Crosstown
Maintenance Facilities are examples of recent
capital investments made by Metrolinx to
improve maintenance of rolling stock. These
facilities have not been designed to
accommodate Hydrail and the cost and impact
on timeline of retrofits, if required, is unknown.

A report detailing the impact of Hydrail on existing
maintenance facilities should be completed. This
would include an understanding of costs and
timelines associated with improvements (e.g.,
mechanical, electrical, safety).

Alternatively, full integration of the supply chain
identified in Figure 4-48 could be accomplished
with one large procurement with the risk of fuel
not being available being fully passed to the
private partner.

This may not be an issue; however, to date there is
a lack of clarity on this potential issue.

4.10.6 Procurement Factors
Innovation through procurement is essential for governments to obtain the best value for money on
major initiatives like the RER strategy. Allowing the private sector to determine the best solution for
meeting certain program and service level needs, within performance specifications to be developed
by government, has proven to produce positive results across various infrastructure types and
jurisdictions. Applying these same principles to rolling stock and associated infrastructure throughout
the GO network is an option that may be pursued, depending on the results of discussions with
industry.
If Project Specific Output Specifications (PSOS) are drafted to allow Hydrail approaches to meet
government’s needs, rather than specify that certain technologies must or must not be used, there will
be room for innovative and cost-effective approaches that capture the purchase, operations,
maintenance of rolling stock and infrastructure (for example, supply chain for hydrogen fuel or
electrification of the network) required to make the system function long term.
The alternative would be to specify the type of technology or particular approach to infrastructure that
must be used either for the entire GO network or for particular sections. This can be done through a
traditional (that is, Design-Bid-Build) procurement model or also by tightening performance
specifications in such a way that only one solution may be technically compliant during evaluation.
Although this approach may be required in certain unique circumstances (for example, requirement
to meet legislation or stakeholder concerns), industry will be constrained in their approaches to
innovation the more constraints that are put on the procurement parameters.
This typically has the impact of increased timeline and cost, which ultimately reduces value for money
long term.

4.10.6.1 Procurement and Project Objectives
Major capital initiatives like the RER strategy have focussed on determining what desired outcomes
are for a successful procurement. The intent is to choose the right tools that will ultimately offer a
highly effective solution to meeting both short and long-term needs of the organization. The first step
of this process is typically to develop project and procurement objectives, which provide a high-level
indication of considerations and constraints specific to the Project, which would be used to assess the
strategic alignment of different procurement options available to Metrolinx. The information below
provides an example of what these objectives might look like for RER.
Project Objectives


The desired public transit service objectives



To comply with affordability criteria



Financial and planning flexibility regarding long term strategic objectives



The nature of the assets and services to be delivered (longevity and quality)



Value engineering or innovation provided by the private sector



Local contractor involvement in the Project and the extent to which training and education
opportunities are provided

Procurement Objectives


The degree of participation in the procurement process and the competition generated



The fairness and transparency of the process



The extent to which Metrolinx receives schedule and cost certainty from the private sector
contractors



The ability to optimally allocate risk between the government and private sector



Ability to ensure no loss of service and to limit risk to government



Compliance with existing trade agreements (for example, Agreement on Internal Trade)

It is important to note that these have not been discussed with Metrolinx to date and are only
provided to illustrate how organizational objectives may impact the procurement model that is
ultimately chosen. Analysis is typically undertaken, beginning with a workshop setting, to narrow
down options to those that will delivered on desired outcomes.

4.10.6.2 Procurement options – Hydrail focus
There are numerous procurement options that may be considered for delivery of a Hydrail solution,
should this be chosen as a possible technical solution to meet Metrolinx’s long-term needs. These
options should be developed based on the size of the project scope, timeline considerations,
optimization of risk transfer, value for money and other objectives.
Various funding mechanisms have been explored in other similar studies (for example, CaH2Net),
including market-based concepts, subsidization of industry often through tax breaks and/or grants to
allow for development, sole-source mandates for a period of time until an industry is mature and
other reinforcing approaches like financial or non-financial awards and incentives. Although these
models may be successful in some instances, they are not believed to be applicable for what
Metrolinx is working towards accomplishing on the GO network. There may be potential however for
certain funding mechanisms to be used on smaller scope items connected to the initiative (for
example, licences to sell hydrogen to other customers beyond Metrolinx).
Although many options exist, for the purposes of this report, there are two potential procurement
approaches that are explored further as potential options to meet known objectives. This analysis is
not intended to be comprehensive in nature, as limited information still exists; however, it does
provide an indication of potential solutions for incorporating Hydrail into the RER strategy. Further
discussion and analysis will be required depending on the outcome of this Report.
Option 1: Broadened Output Specifications on Integrated DBFOM to Accommodate Hydrail
It may not be good practice to choose between overhead electrification and Hydrail at this point in
the project, but instead allow the market some flexibility to determine best value within certain
government established parameters (that is, PSOS during procurement). Recent decisions have been
made to undertake an Integrated DBFOM procurement, rather than separating the infrastructure from
the rolling stock and operator. This is an opportunity for Hydrail, since the infrastructure required for
the supply chain is integral to the operations of the rolling stock.
Unless the Government of Ontario plans to use Hydrail as a catalyst to build the hydrogen
transportation industry to support a larger Province-wide strategy, the procurement can be structured
to allow for various technical solutions within defined PSOS. These specifications (and proposal
evaluation criteria) can focus on maximum GHG emissions, noise, land available, level of service
requirements (for example, trip time, passenger volume), safety requirements, as well as price, and
many other important factors.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

As the indicative design is being developed in advance of release of an RFP, considerations would
need to be given to Hydrail to ensure the PSOS are broad enough to allow for related innovations.
Examples include ensuring land availability for certain elements of the hydrogen production,
developing an appropriate regulatory framework for Hydrail and assisting with skilled workforce
development through universities and colleges.
Private sector consortiums bidding on the RFP would then determine the best approaches, including
both Hydrail and electrification, to ensure technical compliance. A Project affordability ceiling (based
on the indicative design) would be another key constraint outside of technical compliance. Metrolinx
would need to be more open to innovations under this approach and the market would likely need to
be accepting of more risk associated with technology, operations, land acquisition, stakeholder
consultation and other items. This is because Metrolinx cannot assume direct risk that a private sector
innovation (beyond what is proposed in the indicative design) will not function as planned to provide
the intended service or outcomes that are acceptable to stakeholders and the general public.
A potential variation of this option would be to have two or more separate DBFOM procurements;
however, due to the potential for interface risk and the decision to proceed with an integrated
DBFOM procurement, this option was not explored further in the Report.
Ultimately, this option provides flexibility for the market to determine the most appropriate solution
instead of government dictating that overhead electrification or Hydrail is the desired solution. The
following are potential pros and cons of this approach (Table 4-52).
TABLE 4-52 BROADENING OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS ON INTEGRATED DBFOM TO ACCOMMODATE
HYDRAIL
Pros

Cons

Decisions and associated risks on overhead electrification
vs. Hydrail are shared with the private sector, rather than
assumed 100 percent by government

If Hydrail was considered a catalyst for further hydrogen
industry development, this may not occur

Innovation often leads to lower costs and increased value
for money for the same quality of service envisioned

More time may be required to broaden PSOS to allow for
Hydrail, which could delay the planned schedule

Stakeholder consultation risk is shared with a private sector
partner, as the technology decision is not the sole
responsibility of government

Some planning (e.g., preparation of stations for overhead
electrification, land acquisition assumptions) may become
redundant depending on the solution chosen

A broadened PSOS may lead to increased industry
competition (that is, not only companies that have
experience with overhead electrification)

There is increased pressure on government to come up
with PSOS that are broad enough to allow for innovation

It should be noted that even if Hydrail is chosen as the preferred technology option on which the
indicative design would be based upon, a broadened PSOS may still be a good procurement
strategy. Innovations outside of existing technical or business assumptions may be possible with a
more flexible approach to procurement of an initiative that is as complicated and unprecedented as
the RER strategy.
Option 2: Hydrail Pilot Projects
Other jurisdictions, specifically Germany, have decided to run pilot projects for new technologies
such as hydrogen powered rail projects to determine feasibility for broader application in the future.
This approach not only allows for adequate testing of a new and mostly unproven technology (that is,
for rail transportation) prior to a larger program-wide implementation, but also allows for time to
develop public acceptability of the technology and overall industry maturity.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

From a procurement standpoint, there several ways that pilot projects can be approached and
implemented. Commitments recently made by the Ontario government have discounted the
possibility of undertaking Hydrail pilot projects prior to proceeding with the electrification of the
entire GO network. Therefore, Hydrail pilot projects may be best suited for sections of the GO
network that are not easily electrified for various reasons, including flooding and stakeholder
concerns. These are sections where diesel locomotives may be the natural alternative if overhead
electrification is not possible or desirable. This approach, although workable from a level of service
perspective, is not believed to be aligned to the Province’s low emissions goals.
Hydrail pilot projects may be procured separately or as a package under various models using more
traditional approaches where full design is completed or various AFP approaches. These
procurement options have not been analyzed in detail for this Report; however, risk transfer with the
private delivery partner may be better suited for a packaged DBFOM, rather than more traditional
design, bid, build (DBB).
These potential pilot projects may also be considered for integration with the larger integrated
DBFOM strategy, but further analysis and discussion with industry and stakeholders would be
required before this approach was considered. Since Project Co. is expected to take over
responsibility of the existing Metrolinx fleet currently servicing the GO network, this approach may
provide the best opportunity for innovation and incorporation of leading asset management practices
(that is, using the diesel locomotives until replacement is required for asset management reasons).
The following are potential pros and cons of this approach (Table 4-53).
TABLE 4-53 RUNNING PILOT PROJECTS FOR HYDRAIL
Pros

Cons

Testing of the Hydrail related technology would occur prior
to a program-wide implementation sometime in the future,
which would lessen the risk profile for government

There is likely interface risk between the Hydrail pilot
projects and the rest of the GO network if overhead
electrification is implemented on the rest of the network
This approach may lead to a separation of sections
throughout the GO network, which could lead to
inefficiencies; however, this may be at least partially
mitigated with good planning.

A more natural development of the hydrogen fuel industry
will occur if the pilot project is successful

The scale of pilot projects is smaller and economies of scale
may be impacted on the rest of the network, which may
lead to higher cost delivery of services

Government reduces its risk of the technology not working
and service being significantly interrupted to a confined
section(s) of the network

Innovations, cost savings and other positive features of
Hydrail, should they be realized, will be limited to smaller
sections of the network

The timing of pilot projects can be aligned to the
diminishing useful life of existing diesel locomotives, which
may be proven to be a good value for taxpayer money (i.e.,
not abandoning good quality diesel locomotives
immediately)

Duplication of operators, maintenance providers and
infrastructure to support the entire network will likely result,
as different approaches will be required for Hydrail and
overhead electrification

4.10.7 Timeline Considerations
Many of the outstanding commercial and procurement related aspects of Hydrail will take
considerable amounts of time to address. Although many of these issues can be addressed in parallel,
others require a more sequential approach. For instance, a review and purchase of land to
accommodate hydrogen generation and storage is only possible once it is known where capacity
exists for both electricity on the grid and water for the hydrolysis process.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

The procurement model and approach to proceed with Hydrail (pilot project on a portion of the
network vs. application for the entire network), should it be deemed to be a good option, is also likely
to impact the timeline of the RER strategy. The current plan for procurement of overhead
electrification of the GO network is:


RFQ – spring 2018 to summer 2018



RFP – summer 2018 to summer 2019



Financial close late 2019

It is unclear if preparations for accommodating Hydrail within this currently planned timeline could be
achieved, especially since various Hydrail implementation/procurement options may still be chosen. If
Hydrail is pursued as separate pilot projects, it more likely that the existing critical path for overhead
electrification could be achieved.
In any case, if Hydrail is to be considered alongside or shortly following the existing overhead
electrification timeline, the following actions should be started in early 2018:


Further clarification and development of the regulatory framework to support Hydrail and the
related supply chain



Continue working with industry (that is, train manufacturers) to better understand what is possible
to facilitate the inclusion of hydrogen powered rolling stock



Continue engaging with potential investors to better understand their willingness to accept risk on
new technology on a major infrastructure project



Develop and implement a labour force strategy to ensure adequate supply of qualified labour to
support Hydrail once it is in operation



Broadening of PSOS to allow for Hydrail (only if it is being allowable as an innovation through the
planned integrated DBFOM procurement)



Develop a supply and demand strategy for electricity and water to support hydrogen production
along or near the GO network corridor



Develop a land acquisition study and follow up implementation strategy to accommodate Hydrail
(that is, bidders are unlikely to want to take the risk of acquiring land to accommodate the
hydrogen production and distribution supply chain when government has expropriation rights)



Ensure that the Hydrail option is aligned (or at least not prevented from being achieved) with
existing Package 1 and 2 design work. This should be done in advance of procurements through
design requirements, similar to how installation of four Overhead Catenary System (OCS) concrete
bases are being installed during station developments to accommodate overhead electrification
of the Go network.

At some point in early 2018, a go/no-go decision needs to be made on how or if Hydrail will be
approached to meet Metrolinx RER Strategy goals. This date may be further into the future if separate
pilot projects are being pursued; however, a decision still needs to be made in early 2018 as to what
the scope of these pilot projects will be because there will be implications for the larger integrated
DBFOM procurement.

Transition Plan

This section describes how the Hydrail System could become operational within the RER program.

4.11.1 Strategy to Introduce Hydrail
A DBFOM RFQ and RFP process is presently being prepared for the RER program. The timeline for
this process is still under review but is presently planned to be launched at the end of Q1-2018, with
the RFP issuance in Q4-2018. Given the significance of this procurement, a contract award for this
scope of work is not anticipated until the end of Q1-2020.
The DBFOM contract is expected to cover the infrastructure modifications required for RER
independently of the rolling stock technology, for example track, signalling, communications, stations.
It will also give the opportunity to the different proponents to propose their preferred electrification
solution; either wired, with the installation of an overhead catenary system, or a wireless alternative
that could be addressed by Hydrail.
As a result, the DBFOM procurement process is likely to be a strong influencing factor in the decision
concerning whether Hydrail is implemented.
Considering the scenario that Hydrail is the preferred electrification solution of the successful DBFOM
proponent, there are several important factors for consideration in determining how Hydrail could be
brought into service:
1. Decisions about where and how the hydrogen is to be produced, and how the HFC-powered rail
vehicles will be refuelled will influence how long it will take to design and implement the required
static infrastructure:


As part of the scope of work that is described in the Next Steps section we are recommending
the further study is undertaken in these areas;



However, the milestones of first vehicle testing, production vehicle testing and commissioning,
and initial service on one corridor could all be achieved using temporary facilities and shortterm supply contracts.

2. The design of a HFC-powered locomotive or EMU will also depend on decisions and progress
relating to the specification and design of the:


RER train service plan



Rail vehicle performance requirements and technical specifications



Signalling system



Train protection system



Rail vehicle stabling and maintenance facilities.

All of these factors are outside the scope of the Hydrail program to assess at this stage in terms of
how they will be undertaken and what milestone dates are achievable.
3. The decision as to which corridor to use to introduce an initial Hydrail service will depend on:


The RER infrastructure upgrade plan and actual progress made against this plan



Which corridor represents the optimum choice in terms of benefits delivery from the enhanced
performance of electric trains.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

As with point 2, these factors are outside the scope of the Hydrail program to assess at this stage
in terms of how they will be undertaken and what milestone dates are achievable.
In relation to considering the Hydrail System’s ability to transition into service, it is significant to
understand that a Hydrail service can be commenced incrementally once individual rail vehicles are
commissioned and approved for service, and a basic supporting fuelling and maintenance
infrastructure is in place.
This compares to the overhead catenary system where a whole corridor would need to be completed
and commissioned before revenue services could commence.

4.11.2 Timescales
On the assumption that the first set of factors do not impose a constraint on the ability of Hydrail to be
implemented at its preferred pace, and that we can take advantage of an incremental start of service,
the proposed transition plan for Hydrail is outlined in the schedule below (Figure 4-49).
FIGURE 4-49 TRANSITION PLAN SCHEDULE

Some of the key assumptions underlying this proposed transition plan are that:


Key learnings from the HFC Bi-level EMU Concept Design and the HFC Locomotive Concept
Design projects are incorporated into the DBFOM process;



Key learnings from the HFC locomotive detailed design, build and test project are incorporated
into the Hydrail Rail Vehicle Design project and the build and testing of the first Hydrail vehicles;



Key learnings from the Hydrail subsystems concept designs (as defined in the “Recommended
Next Steps” section) are incorporated into the Hydrail Infrastructure Design and Build project;



Other activities particularly those relating to the definition of how railway operations would be
managed for a Hydrail System and how regulatory approval would be achieved are successfully
completed.

On this basis, it is considered feasible that the production of HFC rail vehicles could commence in
2023 and that an initial service on one corridor could commence in mid-2024. If this initial service is
then incrementally enhanced over the course of a year it would then be possible to introduce HFC rail
vehicles into service on the other corridors in accordance with the rate at which they are
manufactured.

Risks and Opportunities

The successful implementation of the Hydrail System would require significant and unique challenges
to be managed. Successfully managing such a large program would be inherently ‘risky’ due to the
uncertainty and complexity associated with integrating hydrogen technologies in a heavy rail context
on such a large scale.
The objective of this section is to explore and evaluate those sources of uncertainty and complexity
which could have an impact on the cost, timing, performance and other benefits of the Hydrail System
and to compare these as an alternative to the planned electrification solution.
Our assessment classifies risks in three categories of when the risk might occur:


System Design Risks – these are risks that could occur during the Hydrail System design phase,



System Implementation Risks – these are risks that could occur during the Hydrail System
implementation phase, and



System Operation Risks – these are risks that could occur during the operation of the Hydrail
System.

The risks have been evaluated in terms of:


Our assessment of the probability of the risk occurring based on our current level of knowledge of
the risk – this is represented as high, medium, or low,



The significance of the impact that the risk would have on achieving the objectives of the Hydrail
Program if this risk occurs – this is represented as high, medium, or low.

The risk assessment also contains our recommendations of the actions that could be taken to mitigate
the probability and/or significance of the risk.
At the same time, we have also identified opportunities for Hydrail to generate benefits in addition to
those assessed in the feasibility study. These Hydrail opportunities are described at the end of the
section.

4.12.1 System Design Risks
4.12.1.1 Regulatory Framework for HFC Rail Vehicles
There might be significant concerns raised by Transport Canada relating to the crashworthiness,
refuelling, maintenance, and degraded service of the hybrid HFC subsystem on rail vehicle.


Type: System Design.



Probability of risk occurring: Medium - There are many codes and standards that will apply to the
design of the fuel cell subsystems. There is also the experience of gaining regulatory approval of
the Alstom train in Germany. However, there is a lack of experience of the use of hydrogen within
Transport Canada and there is the potential for the process of obtaining safety case approval to be
protracted.



Significance: High – If this risk occurs it could add a significant amount of time to the planned
milestones of commencing Hydrail train services.



Mitigation: Proactive engagement with Transport Canada to discuss and develop a
comprehensive safety risk assessment through out all the development stages of Hydrail. Parallel

engagement with TSSA and CSA to help demonstrate the existing certification for individual HFC
system components.


Comparative assessment with Electrification: There is less risk to electrification, since electric
locomotives and EMUs operate on many rail systems. The common risk that would apply to both
Hydrail and Electrification is in the use of UIC compliant EMUs on GO, which has traditionally
operated FRA compliant passenger and freight locomotives.

4.12.1.2 Model-related Risks
The development of the Hydrail Operational Simulation Model required making assumptions about
future operations and costs, in addition to assumptions about system operations and train
performance. There is a risk that these assumptions could be significantly too optimistic, resulting in
higher than expected operating costs, more developmental risk, or poorer performance than
anticipated.


Type: System Design



Probability of risk occurring - Low



The development of the Hydrail Operational Simulation Model involved engagement with subject
matter experts in the industry and research institutions and universities. In addition to this, the
components being modelled exist as individual units and are highly scalable. Input and reviews
from multiple parties will have reduced the risk of too optimistic assumptions.



Significance – Medium



While there is uncertainty around some of the assumptions, a thorough sensitivity analysis around
these assumptions has lowered the level of uncertainty. Additionally, contingency percentages are
included in the operational simulation modelling estimates.



Mitigation: It is proposed to carry out further development work on the Operational Simulation
Model as part of the “Recommmended Next Steps” activities defined in Section 6.



Comparative assessment with Electrification: There is a similar risk within the modelling that has
been done for electrification in relation to the forecast capital and operating costs. However, this
should be lower than for the Hydrail System because the scope is better defined and there will be
fewer assumptions.

4.12.1.3 System Integration Complexity of the HFC Rail Vehicles
There is a risk that the design period of the HFC rail vehicles is greater than planned due to
unexpected complexities that emerge in integrating the hybrid HFC subsystem into the existing EMU
and locomotive platforms.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring – Medium
The feasibility study report from Hydrogenics on the HFC locomotive has not identified any
significant systems integration risks and we know from the Alstom Coradi iLint, the CRRC Gaoming
project and other one-off rail vehicle projects that this is not an insurmountable problem.
However, we also know that modern rail vehicles are complex machines where equipment needs
to be installed in very confined spaces. Therefore, it would not be surprising if some system
integration challenges are encountered during the design phase which require unplanned scope
of work to resolve.

Revision B

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT



Significance – Medium
If this risk occurs it could have a consequential impact in the start of the build phase and,
therefore, on the start of revenue services. However, we would be confident that these types of
issues could be resolved through focussed engineering effort which would not have a significant
impact on the development, test and build durations of the HFC rail vehicles.



Mitigation: The current HFC Rail Vehicle Projects, within the Hydrail Program scope, are intended
to be part of the process of mitigating this risk by investigating, at a conceptual level, how a hybrid
HFC subsystem would be integrated into a locomotive and a bi-level EMU platforms. The outputs
of this work are intended to inform the RER rail vehicle systems engineering strategy that will be
adopted by the rail vehicle manufacturer.



Comparative assessment with Electrification: There is no significant risk to electrification, since
electric locomotives and EMUs exist in the market and do not require any additional equipment to
be integrated into them to meet the RER electrification requirements.

4.12.1.4 Operational Range of the HFC Rail Vehicles
There is a risk that the HFC locomotive or the HFC EMU will need to be refueled with hydrogen within
their daily operational hours to be able to operate the planned number of trips in the RER train service
plan.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring – Medium
Assumptions have been made in the Operational Simulation model about the space that will be
available on the rail vehicles for the storage of hydrogen. The HFC locomotive and HFC EMU
concept design projects might identify that these assumptions are too optimistic and that the
amount of hydrogen, in gas form, that can be carried should be reduced, which in turn will reduce
the range that the rail vehicle can operate before refuelling.



Significance – Medium
If this risk occurs it would have an impact on the operation of the Hydrail System as it would
require refuelling of the rail vehicles to take place within the operating day. The impact of this on
the proposed RER train service plan and fleet size is unclear; however, it would not be substantially
different from the impact of the refuelling that takes place during the day for the current fleet of
diesel locomotives.



Mitigation: It is planned to mitigate this risk by:
a) setting the rail vehicle manufacturers, working on the concept designs, the objective of
maximising the volume of compressed gas hydrogen that can be accommodated on their
vehicles, without compromising functionality and safety
b) optimising the train service patterns and associated duty cycles that a Hydrail rail service would
operate to minimize the amount of hydrogen that would be needed for an all-day service
without refuelling.



Comparative assessment with Electrification: There is no significant risk to electrification, since
electric locomotives and EMUs do not carry their own fuel on-board and can draw as power as
they need, when they need it, from the overhead catenary system.

4.12.1.5 Performance of the HFC rail vehicles
There is a risk that it might not be possible to design the HFC rail vehicles so that they can operate the
proposed RER train service plan on each corridor.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring – Medium
The sizing of the components of the hybrid HFC subsystem for the HFC locomotive and the HFC
EMU has been calculated to meet the acceleration and peak power demands needed to operate
the RER train service plan. This sizing has been undertaken by CNL and has been corroborated
independently by modelling from Hydrogenics as part of their HFC locomotive support services.
However, HFC rail vehicles with the required performance characteristics have not been built
before and therefore there could be unknown risks that emerge during the design phase that
could reduce the forecast performance capability.



Significance – Medium
If this risk occurs it is only likely to reduce the expected performance levels by a relatively small
amount, which in turn should not significantly affect the BCR for the project.



Mitigation: It is planned to mitigate this risk by undertaking more detail calculations, during the
next stage of the project, of the performance of the hybrid HFC subsystem based on a clearer
definition of the required duty cycles for each corridor.
We will also consider the opportunity (described below) of designing the hybrid HFC subsystem
with a slightly reduced performance objective to determine the impact that this would have on
system capital and operating cost compared to the resulting reduction in RER benefits.



Comparative assessment with Electrification: There is no significant risk to electrification, since the
train service plan for RER has been designed to be achievable using currently available electric
locomotives and BL EMUs.

4.12.1.6 Environmental Assessments
The Hydrail System will require Environmental Assessments to be undertaken for the hydrogen
production facilities. There is a risk that this process will take longer than planned, creating challenges
in achieving the committed dates for RER service.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - The likelihood that this risk will occur is currently Medium
as there has not yet been any engagement with the planning authorities.



Significance: Medium - If environmental compliance and approvals are not achieved by about
2022 it would have an impact on the commencement of construction of these facilities.



Mitigation: Proactive engagement will be required with the MOECC, local conservation
authorities, and municipal and provincial governments to begin the Environmental Approval
process.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: Environmental assessments for the Electrification
work is underway and engagement has already commenced with local authorities to meet RER
dates. However, there could be objections raised from local residents to the network in relation to
construction noise, vegetation removal and visual intrusion.

4.12.1.7 Infrastructure Required for Hydrail
The electrolyzer, storage and refuelling subsystems will need to be designed to allow for efficient
operations of the Hydrail network. The detailed design of this infrastructure needs further
investigation and there is a risk that a fundamental scope or process issue will be discovered during
this work that will have a significant impact on the expected efficiency and cost of operation.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - The Hydrail System uses standard off-the-shelf
componentswhose performance characteristics are proven.



Significance: High - The impact of this risk is significant as it could have a significant impact on the
functional and economic viability of Hydrail.



Mitigation: It is intended to mitigate this risk by undertaking concept designs of these subsystems
as described in the “Recommended Next Steps” section.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: This is a low risk for electrification. Overhead wires
and signalling immunization will need to be installed. The risk is mitigated by the know-how that
exists in the industry.

4.12.1.8 Technological Development of Hydrail
Since a Hydrail System has not yet been implemented at the scale RER requires, there could be
challenges related to the scaling of the HFC subsystems, and potential performance limitations due
challenges in systems integration.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - This is mainly a systems integration risk that will be
approached through engineering design with major equipment manufacturers. The risk that scale
effects could have a significant detrimental impact is low as the components are modular.



Significance: Medium - If system integration issues do occur, particularly with the rail vehicles and
the refuelling facility it could delay the start of implementation or reduce the performance of the
Hydrail System below expected levels.



Mitigation: The development of the concept designs and subsequent prototypes will allow a
detailed analysis of the system integration and scalability. Engagement with major industry
manufacturers and universities to test concepts in their testing facilities will help evolve the design
to the requisite levels of performance and reliability.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: There is a lower risk to electrification, since OCS
equipment and electric rail vehicles use technology that have a high level of component
development and systems integration. Locomotives and EMUs are certified and exist in the
market.

4.12.1.9 Private Sector Risk Assessment of Hydrail
It is currently intended that the Hydrail System is included in the RER DBFOM procurement scope.
Due to the unfamiliarity that many proponents will have with hydrogen and the Hydrail System they
could consider it to contain a high level of risk, resulting in them applying a significant cost premium
to it for the development, operation and maintenance of the system.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - The likelihood that this risk occurs will be driven by how
the risk profile of Hydrail is seen to compare to that of Electrification, and how the risk transfer
mechanisms are defined in the DBFOM contract.



Significance: High - There is a high level of significance related to this risk as it will be a
fundamental driver as to whether the Hydrail System is preferred to Electrification.



Mitigation: It is intended to mitigate this risk by undertaking further development work on the
definition and design of the Hydrail System across several areas, including: subsystems concept
designs, hydrogen production locations, railway operations, capital and operating costs, transition
plan, and codes and standards. The scope of this work is outlined in the Recommended Next
Steps section.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: Potential proponents might also see a high level of
risk associated with Electrification in relation to the: capital cost of implementation, operating cost,
and transfer of risks such as utilities diversions and operational disruption.

4.12.1.10 Implications to RER Scope of Work due to Hydrail
There is a risk that the functional requirements of the Hydrail System might require significant
additional infrastructure within the scope of work of RER.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - The feasibility study has not identified areas of the operation of
the Hydrail System that are likely to have a significant impact on the scope of the RER
infrastructure. The area that this risk is most relevant to is the design of the stabling yards in
relation to the: design of the refuelling storage and dispensing facilities, and design of station
platforms for the operation of 12 carriage consists with 12 locomotives.



Significance: Medium - The objective of the refuelling system for Hydrail is to replicate the
operational functionality of refuelling the current diesel fleet. However, the implications of
refuelling a much larger fleet of trains than currently exists will make this process more
complicated than at present.



Mitigation: A thorough study with Metrolinx Planning and Policy, and Fleet Operations will need to
be conducted to better understand the RER service plan approach. Following this, a technical
analysis will be conducted with Fleet Engineering to understand the impact of HFC locomotives
and EMUs to achieve the RER level of service.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: The scope of RER is currently being designed to
meet the functional requirements of Electrification. The likelihood of additional infrastructure work
needing to be undertaken within the scope of the Electrification program will relate to risks such
as unexpected utilities diversions and existing infrastructure modifications.

4.12.1.11 Impact on Hydrail Scope of Work due to RER
There is a risk that the RER scope of work could have a negative impact on Hydrail.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - The definition of the RER scope of infrastructure and train
services is still evolving and therefore it is likely that changes from the current definition will have
an impact on Hydrail.



Significance: Medium - There may be constraints of the feasible locations for the hydrogen
production and refuelling facilities. Additionally, train service patterns may affect the required
performance characteristics and range of the HFC rail vehicles.



Mitigation: As part of the proposed “Recommended Next Steps” it will be important for the Hydrail
team to continue to work closely with the RER Program team to understand evolutions in the RER
infrastructure scope, fleet strategy and timetable.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: There is no impact on electrification

4.12.1.12 New Emerging Technology by 2025
Technology developments in propulsion systems could create a feasible lower cost alternative to
Hydrail. Continuing innovations in the rail industry could usurp the Hydrail option. As an example,
battery-only trains are also being tested in various parts of the world. With the significant level of
funding and research into battery technology from major automotive companies, a breakthrough in
that sector is possible.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - It has been suggested that battery-only trains could be a viable
alternative to Hydrail. However, there are fundamental issues with the power to weight ratios of
battery systems that mean they are unlikely to be an appropriate solution for a heavy demand
commuter network like GO. In addition, the research improvements in battery technologies that
are frequently publicized are unlikely to be commercially available within the time frames required
by RER.



Significance: Low - Although battery only technology might become a viable propulsion system
for rail vehicles in the future this is likely to be limited to light rail vehicles.



Mitigation: The Hydrail team will continue to monitor industry and technology trends to assess
whether the likelihood of occurrence of this risk changes.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: The same risk applies to electrification.

Table 4-54 collates the risks identified above and orders them using a rough risk ranking score of

4.12.2 System Implementation Risks
4.12.2.1 Public Perception of Hydrogen
Misconceptions by the public about the safety risk ofhydrogen might cause commuters and local
neighbourhoods to resist the implementation of Hydrail.


Type: System Implementation



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium – This is based on current perceptions of hydrogen.
However, a focused public relations effort should be able to mitigate this risk.



Significance: Medium – Negative perceptions of safety risks could adversely impact on the location
of hydrogen production and storage facilites and GO ridership levels.



Mitigation: Engage with Metrolinx public relations and communications teams to overcome these
prejudices, using a comprehensive public engagement strategy.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: Electrification does not have this same risk.

4.12.2.2 Uncertainty Regarding Rate at which HFC Rail Vehicles can be
Introduced into Revenue Service
There is a risk that the duration between the DBFOM contract award and the planned start of the
enhanced RER services is insufficient to fully develop, test and deliver the required HFC rail vehicles.


Type: System Implementation



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - Since HFC technology of the scale required for Hydrail has
not previously been integrated into a rail vehicle this risk relates to system integration, train control
and safety regulation issues that might emerge as the rail vehicles are designed and tested.



Significance: High - This risk has high significance because the key objective of the RER Program is
to introduce enhanced rail services on the GO network from 2025.

Revision B

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT



Mitigation: Metrolinx has already initiated the two HFC rail vehicle projects to mitigate this risk.
The HFC Bi-level EMU Concept Design Project has the objective of obtaining assurance that a
hybrid HFC system can be integrated into manufacturers existing EMU products. The HFC
Locomotive Concept Design Project has a similar objective and in addition will further progress
the systems integration development by proceeding with preliminary and detailed designs. It is
intended that this work is completed during the DBFOM procurement process so that bidders can
confidently plan for the production design and delivery of an HFC rail vehicle fleet within the
required RER timescales.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: The equivalent uncertainty in relation to the
Electrification Program relates to the timescales for completing the electrification infrastructure on
each GO corridor. If significant risks emerge in relation to corridor access, utilities diversions and
infrastructure modifications then this could also delay the achievement of the 2025 target.

4.12.2.3 Ability of Market to Provide Equipment and Design Services
There is a risk that hydrogen technology component vendors will have trouble scaling up to supply
the quantity of hydrogen infrastructure required by the Hydrail System.


Type: System Implementation



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - Even though individual vendors will be able to anticipate
that Hydrail is likely to procure a considerable volume of components they may not be able to
scale-up within the time required by RER. However, the whole hydrogen market is expanding in
parallel to the development of Hydrail so the risk is likely to be reduced.



Significance: Medium - A delay in the initial supply of key subsystem components would lead to a
delay in the commencement of services and slow down the incremental roll-out.



Mitigation: Proactive engagement with the market and provincial government to share the
ongoing development efforts. This will provide the hydrogen market with expectations, allowing
them to ramp up on their ability to deliver services.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: Electrification components are commoditized, and
since there are major players with electric locomotives and EMUs which are certified and exist in
the market, there are fewer uncertainties about the ability of the market to provide equipment and
services related to electrification.

4.12.2.4 Zoning and Planning
There might be objections raised by planning authorities and local communities to proposed
locations for the hydrogen production facilities.


Type: System Implementation



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - The likelihood of this risk occurring will depend on the
number of location options that are available and the success of the preceding public
communication strategy.



Significance: Medium - If there are delays in obtaining planning consents it would still be possible
to commence an initial Hydrail service through the purchase of hydrogen from existing industrial
suppliers.



Mitigation: Proactive engagement will be required with the municipal and provincial governments
to begin the planning work and obtain the zoning approvals required to set up the support
infrastructure for Hydrail.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: Electrification also has planning consent risks in
relation to the siting of substations.

Table 4-55 collates the risks identified above and orders them using a rough risk ranking score of
Probability multiplied by Significance, based on High = 3, Medium = 2 and Low = 1.

4.12.3 System Operational Risks
4.12.3.1 Forecasting the Future Price of Electricity
The actual average price differential between peak and off-peak rates might change from the forecast
rates provided by IESO.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - The electricity price forecasts used to calculate the
operating costs of Hydrail and Electrification have been provided by IESO and are based on the
2017 Long Term Energy Plan for Ontario



Significance: High – If the differencebetween the price of electricity paid by Hydrail and that for
Electrification narrows, this would weaken the economic case for Hydrail.



Mitigation: Engage with the provincial government to define, or pre-establish, the cost of
electricity relating to Hydrail.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: If the difference between the price of electricity paid
by Hydrail and that for Electrification increases, this would weaken the economic case for
Electrification.

4.12.3.2 Hydrail Operational Complexity
There are uncertainties about how HFC rail vehicles will be brought into service at the start of each
day and refuelled at the end of each day. There are also uncertainties around the type and frequency
of maintenance and renewal operations of the HFC components. These could have a significant
negative impact on the expected operational efficiency of the RER level of service.

Revision B

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT



Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - The probability of there being a significant negative
impact on the RER level of service from the adoption of HFC rail vehicles is not considered to be
high as Metrolinx currently has experience of managing a fleet of rail vehicles that requires
refuelling every day and that requires in-house maintenance activities to be carried out on the
vehicles’ propulsion systems.



Significance: High - This is a risk that is important because one of the key factors in determining
the viability of the Hydrail System is ensuring that it has a high level of operational efficiency



Mitigation: As part of the proposed “Recommended Next Steps” activities it is intended to
undertake further analysis of the operational capabilities of the Hydrail System and how they align
with the RER level of service.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: This is a much lower risk for the Electrification
Program as electric locomotives and EMUs have well proven operational and maintenance
requirements. In addition, the electric rail vehicles do not require to be refuelled.

4.12.3.3 Maintenance Staff Capabilities
It might be difficult to find sufficient numbers of staff with the specialized skills to maintain the Hydrail
System components, both on the locomotive and at offsite facilities.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - The likelihood of this risk occurring is low because there is
sufficient time to mitigate it and the demand for skilled hydrogen technicans will follow the
incremental introduction of an HFC fleet.



Significance: Medium - The impact of this risk will be on train service performance.



Mitigation: Engage with Ontario Ministry of Advanced Education and colleges in Ontario to ensure
that courses are available to train and certify existing and new staff as hydrogen technicians.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: Electrification will have a similar risk, since the new
electric locomotives and EMUs will require maintenance staff with new skills.

4.12.3.4 Hydrogen Production Failure
There is a risk of a shortage of supply of hydrogen due to a failure in the hydrogen production
subsystem or in the supply of electricity from the grid.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - The probability of this occurring is low as it is intended to store
up to three days supply of hydrogen at each hydrogen production facility. If this is not sufficient at
one particular location, contingency plans will be put in place to transport hydrogen from one of
the other production facilities.



Significance: Medium - This is not a significant risk as there will be built-in supply buffers in the
system to limit the severity of the impact.



Mitigation: As part of the proposed “Recommended Next Steps” activities it is intended to
produce a concept design of a generic hydrogen production facility. Within the design process
consideration will be given to mitigating this risk to an acceptable level.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: There is an equivalent risk in the Electrification
Program which relates to the reliability of supply of electricity. Redundancy has been built into the
connection of the OCS with the electricity grid to reduce this risk to an acceptable level.

4.12.3.5 Reliability of HFC Trains
There is a risk that the availability and performance of the HFC rail vehicles could be compromised
due to failures of components in the rail vehicle subsystem.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - A rail vehicle is a harsh environment particularly due to
climatic conditions and vibration. However, there is a considerable amount of experience of
operating HFC-powered buses where these conditions are probably worse than on a rail network.
In addition, the HFC subsystem will be designed so that the failure of one component will not have
a catastrophic impact on the operation of the rail vehicle. For example: the fuel cells will be
arranged in parallel stacks so that a failure of one unit will only result in a reduced amount of
output power and not the shut down of the complete fuel cell subsystem; even if the whole fuel
cell subsystem becomes unavailable there will be sufficient power in the battery system to enable
the rail vehicle to operate in degraded mode so that it can reach a place of safety; the battery
subsystem will also be designed so that a failure in one battery will only lead to a reduction in peak
power available to accelerate the train. It is likely that in this scenario that it will be possible to
continue to operate the train at close to normal performance. Furthermore, the planned train
consists will have the following redundancies: EMUs have multiple powered coaches so that the
train should be able to continue to operate even if the system on coach fails; adopting a two
locomotive consist for 12 carriages means that even if one locomotive fails it will still be possible
for the consist to continue working.



Significance: High - This is a risk of significant importance because it is fundamental to the
operational viability of the Hydrail System.



Mitigation: Gaining assurance about how the HFC rail vehicles will be able to continue to function
is one of the factors that will be investigated as part of the HFC Bi-level Concept Design project
and the HFC Locomotive project.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: There are similar risks with the electric locomotives
and EMUs. Even though there is a highlevel of reliability of the electrical components on an
electric locomotive or an EMU, there is a lower level of sytem redundancy than with a HFC rail
vehicle. In addition, any failure of the overhead contact wire on a section of corridor would lead to
significant operational disruption.

4.12.3.6 Impact on Passengers of a Train Accident
In the event of a train accident there is the potential that passengers could be hurt due to the ignition
or explosion of leaking hydrogen.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - The likelihood of this is low because: when hydrogen escapes
it disperses into the atmosphere very quickly; if a hydrogen leak does ignite then it burns with a
flame rather than explodes; the hydrogen will be stored on the rail vehicles in multiple tanks so
that it is unlikely that more than one tank would be damaged in an accident; the hydrogen will be
stored at 700 bar in the storage tanks which will encourage the hydrogen to escape quickly; in the
case of the HFC EMU the hydrogen tanks will be installed near the roof of the train where the gas

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

can quickly escape in the event of tank rupture; in the case of the HFC locomotive the tanks will be
isolated from the adjacent passenger coach by a fire proof barrier; the rail vehicle subsystem will
be designed to achieve a high level of crashworthiness; the rail vehicle subsystem will be
designed with automated shut-off systems that are designed to limit the amount of hydrogen that
can escape.


Significance: High - Any risk relating to safety will be treated with the highest level of significance
during the design of the HFC rail vehicles.



Mitigation: Gaining assurance about how the HFC subsystem will respond to an accident will be
part of the activities that we propose to undertake in Q1 and Q2 2018. It will also feature as part of
the HFC Bi-level Concept Design project and the HFC Locomotive project.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: In the event of an electric rail vehicle accident, there
could be a risk to passengers due to damaged overhead catenary infrastructure.

4.12.3.7 Implications to RER due to Hydrail
There is a risk that the operation of the Hydrail System might have a negative impact on the ability to
achieve the planned RER level of service.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - The feasibility study has not identified any area of the
operation of the Hydrail System that is likely to have a significant impact on the operation of RER.
The areas that this risk is most relevant to are: the performance and operation of a two-locomotive
consist; and the refuelling process.



Significance: Medium - The objective of the design of the Hydrail System is to match the RER level
of service in terms of terms of the RER train service plan. If this risk occurs it seems likely that the
reduction in level of service will be small. This risk also generates an opportunity whereby a small
reduction in train performance could lead to a significant reduction in Hydrail’s operating cost.



Mitigation: As part of the proposed “Recommended Next Steps” activities it is intended that the
Hydrail team will develop a more refined assessment of the train service capability of the HFC rail
vehicles and the operating processes of refuelling. We will also work with the RER Program team
to model operating cost savings that could be achieved from a range of reductions in train
performance and how this might impact the BCR for the Hydrail System.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: This exact risk is unlikely to be experienced with
electrification as electric locomotives and EMUs that are available for the major rail vehicle
manufacturers have performance characteristics that have been used in the simulation modelling
of RER. However, there might be the reverse risk if rail vehicles supplied have more performance
characteristics than required for RER (acceleration, top speed).

Table 4-56 collates the risks identified above and orders them using a rough risk ranking score of
Probability multiplied by Significance, based on High = 3, Medium = 2 and Low = 1.
The risks that have a score from 6 to 3 are of sufficient importance that their further investigation is
included within the scope of activities outlined in the “Recommended Next Steps” section.

4.12.4 Opportunities
4.12.4.1 Incremental Service Introduction
Electrification requires the infrastructure on each corridor to be completed before electrified services
can commence.
With the Hydrail System an electrified service can be introduced incrementally starting from a single
HFC rail vehicle on a corridor and then building up to a full service over a period of time.
The benefits of this approach are:


The possible earlier introduction of electrified services on any corridor than would be the case
with electrification which would improve the revenue benefits profile for RER;



Because there is less up-front fixed CAPEX for the Hydrail System compared to Electrification the
NPV for Hydrail is more aligned to the profile of the rolling stock delivery, whereas the NPV for
Electrification is more aligned to the up-front CAPEX. This should create a comparative advantage
for the Hydrail System in the business case analysis.



Most of the capital cost for Hydrail System is related to manufacture of the rolling stock and
therefore this is spread over the production period a longer period over which the capital cost of a
reduced dependency between the completion of RER infrastructure and the introduction of
electric rolling stock onto the GO network which could be beneficial in terms of public relations.

4.12.4.2 Advantage of Using Surplus Electricity
The Hydrail System will generally use surplus baseload electricity generated in the province to
produce hydrogen and will therefore pay for its power using rates that will not include the GA factor.
The OCS electrification option will largely use the higher day time rates of electricity that will also
include the GA.
Because the Hydrail System will use about 15 percent of the surplus power that is generated it
potentially could have an impact on the size of the GA that is added to the bills of all Ontario power
users.

4.12.4.3 Remove Diesel Locomotive Services from the Milton and
Richmond Hill Corridors
The rail infrastructure of the Milton and Richmond Hill corridors are not owned by Metrolinx. As a
result, it is not possible to install overhead electrification infrastructure on these corridors. However,
the Hydrail System option provides the ability to operate electric train services on these two corridors.
The benefits of this would be improved RER services being operated on these corridors and a
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the GO network compared to electrification.
However, there would be additional capital and operating costs for the Hydrail System which would
need to be assessed against the revenue benefits of providing RER services on these corridors.

4.12.4.4 Hydrail as a Catalyst for the Implementation of a ‘Hydrogen Economy’
in Ontario
One of the constraints to the broader adoption of hydrogen as a replacement to fossil fuels as an
energy carrier is the current limited availability of hydrogen outside of industrial applications.
An investment in the infrastructure of hydrogen production and storage could be used as a lever by
the government of Ontario and/or the private sector to make hydrogen available to users outside of
Metrolinx.
There is the opportunity for Metrolinx to work with a broad cross-section of government departments
to develop a strategy similar to that recently published by the South Australia government203 for a
roadmap for a broader use of hydrogen across Ontario.
The potential benefits of this are:


Sharing of the costs of the fixed infrastructure assets



Reductions in the use of fossil fuels as energy sources



Development of businesses and jobs with a hydrogen technology focus



The development of Ontario as a global leader in the implementation of hydrogen technologies



Adoption of hydrogen as an energy storage material in combination with renewable energy
sources and the associated benefits in relation to the stabilization of the electricity grid in response
to variations in demand.

4.12.4.5 Shared Cost of Fixed Infrastructure
Hydrogen could also have other applications within Metrolinx that could then use the same hydrogen
production infrastructure.
Metrolinx is already considering the use of HFC-powered buses as replacements for its diesel bus
fleet.
There is the potential integrate this strategy with the development of the Hydrail System which could
lead to a shared hydrogen production, storage and refuelling infrastructure.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

In addition, there is the potential to use HFCs as main power sources or back-up power sources for
Metrolinx’s property portfolio. This could potentially lead to a reduction in operating costs or at least
improved energy security.

4.12.4.6 Capture of Energy through Regenerative Braking
All modern electric rail vehicles use their traction motors, working in reverse, as part of the vehicle’s
braking system. This means that the traction motor is working as a generator. Regenerative braking is
the ability to capture this electrical energy for a beneficial use.
With rail vehicles operating in an overhead catenary system this energy is fed back into the grid via
the vehicle’s pantograph. The amount of energy that is captured in this way is relatively small
compared to the total potential energy that would be available because there is no resulting benefit
to the operating of the vehicle and so vehicle’s electrical systems are not optimized for this purpose.
With the Hydrail System we believe that there is an opportunity to capture a significant additional
amount of the rail vehicle’s braking energy and to feed it into the batteries and utltracapacitors that
are part of the hybrid HFC subsystem.
We would do this by specifically focusing on the design of the rail vehicle’s electrical systems
(batteries, utltracapacitors and fuel cell) to optimize the amount of energy that can be cost effectively
captured (that is, within the constraints of space availability and equipment cost).
By doing this it should be possible to optimize the design of the subsystem to minimize the volume of
hydrogen that will be consumed on each trip. In this way, it should be possible to increase the overall
range of the Hydrail rail vehicles from what we can be maximized and the minimize the amount of
hydrogen that needs to be produced for the overall Hydrail System.
We plan to investigate this opportunity as part of the HFC Bi-Level EMU and HFC Locomotive projects
that will be undertaken during Q1 and Q2 2018.

RER Program Electrification

This section describes the scope of the currently proposed by the RER Program, including the
proposal for overhead electrification, and the issues that need to be resolved during preliminary
design and implementation.

5.1

Current RER Program

5.1.1

Scope

The Regional Transportation Plan for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), or The Big
Move, identifies the need for a significant increase in rail service across the GO network. Accordingly,
the RER program is being planned to provide more frequent, faster, and higher-capacity service204.
In January 2010, a study of the electrification of the GO rail system was initiated as a future alternative
to diesel trains currently in service. The objective of the Electrification Study was to provide
information so that a decision about how GO trains will be powered in the future – using electricity,
enhanced diesel technology, or other means – can be made, as this fleet propulsion upgrade has a
key role in delivering the Big Move205.
The IBC was published in 2015 and scoped the RER program by defining, analyzing, and reporting
the feasibility of various scenarios for GO RER service and infrastructure206.
In the RER business case, Scenario 1 (Do Minimum) is the base case that assumes a continuation of
today’s peak-focussed service patterns and diesel technology. All other scenarios are compared to it.
Scenario 2 (Two-Way All-Day) and Scenario 3 (10-Year Plan) consider more frequent all-day service,
looking at the costs and benefits of all-diesel and some limited electrification. Scenario 4 (Full Build) is
a maximum-build scenario, with frequent all-day service and overhead electrification on all corridors.
These four scenarios were studied so that different levels of service (LOSs) and infrastructure could be
assessed and compared to understand if and how they would achieve strategic objectives, how much
they would cost to build and operate, and how effective they would be at generating benefits, all
while considering deliverability constraints.
Scenario 5 (10-Year Plan Optimized) was then developed based on available funds and a 10-year
build period for delivery (Figure 5-1). This program includes electrification and frequent service on
most inner corridors207. For the purposes of this feasibility report, Hydrail is assessed against RER
Scenario 5.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

To sum up, by 2024, the GO rail network is planned to:


Be expanded to enable electrified train service in core system areas at 15-minute frequencies or
better



Offer up to four times the current number of train trips during off-peak hours



Offer twice the current number of trips during peak hours throughout the network208

The scope of the RER project, as described in Scenario 5, involves electrification of the following GO
rail corridors:
1. Union Station Rail Corridor (Figure 5-2) – From Union Pearson (UP) Express Union Station to
Don Yard Layover
2. Lakeshore West Corridor – From just west of Bathurst Street (Mile 1.20) to Burlington
3. Kitchener Corridor – From UP Express Spur 8 (at Highway 427) to Bramalea
4. Barrie Corridor – From Parkdale Junction (off Kitchener Corridor) to Allandale GO Station
5. Stouffville Corridor – From Scarborough Junction (off Lakeshore East Corridor) to Lincolnville GO
6. Station
7. Lakeshore East Corridor – From Don Yard Layover to Oshawa GO Station209
Electrification of the system is one of the components of the RER program. It is being undertaken in
parallel with other projects to build all infrastructure needed to increase service210.
The infrastructure must accommodate the busiest hour of service during the peak-hour period, as well
as any track occupancy required by other rail operators (freight and intercity services). During the
peak hours, the number of trains may vary slightly; therefore, the worst-case scenario, or high peak
hour, was used to develop the infrastructure requirements for the 10-year plan (Scenario 5)211.

Figure 5-1 gives us an idea of the breadth of the civil works required to implement the electrification
infrastructure. Further to the overhead catenary system itself, there are signal immunization services to
be implemented, traction power stations to be built, modifications that need to be made to existing
stations, and changes required for existing bridges and layover facilities.

5.1.2

Train Service Plan

All-day EMU services would operate every 15 minutes to Aldershot, Bramalea, Aurora, Unionville, and
Oshawa; with hourly services to Hamilton (diesel, express Oakville-Union), Barrie (EMU, express
Aurora-Union), and Mount Joy (EMU, as an extension of one in four Unionville trains). Milton and
Richmond Hill would remain peak-only diesel corridors214.
Table 5-1 provides a summary of the Scenario 5 train service plan, by corridor. Figure 5-3 shows the peak
periods, while Figure 5-4 shows off-peak periods.

Procurement of Rolling Stock

Passenger rail rolling stock is traditionally built in fleets customized for a specific application. This is
because, although there are standard technical platforms, railways differ sufficiently in local technical
and environmental requirements. In comparison with automobile or even aircraft manufacture,
production runs are considered small218.
In Scenario 5, approximately 140 EMU cars would be required for the Lakeshore route, and
approximately 30 cars for each additional electrified route.
Procurement of a new rolling stock fleet is assumed to take 4 to 8 years, although it may be possible
to reduce this timeframe. The process entails:


Development of the customer requirements (car size, configuration of doors, seats)



Definition of detailed technical requirements



Definition of procurement contracting structure and finance



Option of long-term maintenance contract with extended warranty

Closing sections of track for
extended periods of time enables
the work to be carried out
efficiently on that section, but it
means that there are reduced
services over that section



Closing sections of a corridor for
extended periods of time enables
extensive work to be undertaken
as quickly as possible, but it
means that replacement bus
services need to be put into
operation for that period

Infrastructure
modification

Modifications and rebuilding of
bridges and station canopies to gain
sufficient vertical clearance for OCS
installation

Requires 39 interventions
to modify stations, 19
bridge clearance
interventions, and 2 bridge
rebuild interventions

No

Electrical
immunization
of signalling
and other
systems

Modifications to the signal system
and other electrical systems to
immunize them against the effects of
electromagnetic interference

A cost for this of $703
million has been included
in the IBC

No

Electric
locomotives

Electric locomotives will be used to
replace the existing diesel
locomotives to pull the existing
unpowered BL carriages; t he electric
locomotives will have enhanced
performance characteristics to meet
RER service requirements.

35 units (in 2024)

Yes

EMUs

Might be used as part of the RER
fleet to provide the additional peak
and off-peak services that are
defined in RER.

84 four-car sets (2024)

The periodical preventive
maintenance activities required for
the efficient use of rail vehicles
includes daily cleaning, regular
maintenance and inspection, and the
replacement of mechanical
components. It also includes the
additional effort to maintain rail
vehicles (cleaning, brakes, air dryers,
pantograph carbon strips, and
