Executive Summary

Metrolinx’s Regional Express Rail Program (RER) is the largest transit infrastructure program in
Canadian history that transcends borders and fosters connections between communities across the
Greater Golden Horseshoe. Electrifying Metrolinx-owned segments of the GO Transit (GO) network is
an important part of delivering on a promise to bring faster and more frequent services across the
region; Metrolinx is on track to electrify and expand the rail network, and deliver more two-way,
all-day services by increasing the number of weekly trips from about 1,500 to nearly 6,000 by 2025.
In June 2017, the Minister of Transportation of Ontario announced that Metrolinx would study the
feasibility of using hydrogen fuel cells (HFCs) to electrify the GO network as an alternative to
electrification using conventional overhead wires. Recent advances in the use of HFCs to power
electric trains in other jurisdictions make it important for Ontario to consider this technology as it has
the potential to deliver the planned RER service benefits with reduced cost and time risks.
This report investigates the feasibility of operating the GO network using HFC-powered rail vehicles –
also known as a Hydrail System – based on an expected service model for the GO network that will
start in 2025. It considers both the train service pattern and rail vehicle fleet mix to analyze the
technical and financial requirements for operating the Hydrail System.
The study concludes that it should be technically feasible to build and operate a Hydrail System for
the GO network, and the system’s overall lifetime costs are equivalent to the alternative of a
conventional overhead electrification system.
It is also acknowledged that such a system is complex, and at this scale, would be a world first. This
means that significant challenges would need to be successfully managed to achieve the objective of
starting electrified services on the GO network by 2025.
Two of the most significant of these challenges are:


Fleet implementation – Designing and building a fleet of HFC rail vehicles for RER services would
carry a risk of delay due to the design challenges of integrating the fuel cell system into the rail
vehicle platform and the production challenges of building a full fleet of new vehicles.



Electricity price – Due to the large amount of electricity that will be needed for hydrogen
production (1% of average daily generated supply in Ontario) by the Hydrail System, the
economic viability of Hydrail will depend on how the electricity price variability risk is apportioned
with the private sector. There may need to be a provincial government commitment on this within
the RER procurement process.

However, there are also many significant risks in taking forward the conventional overhead
electrification system that could also impact the 2025 milestone. One key differentiatior between the
two options is that the Hydrail System also creates the opportunity for broader benefits to Ontario in
terms of economic development in the technology sector and as a catalyst for the adoption of
hydrogen in other areas of society.

Hydrail System Structure

The structure of the Hydrail System is shown on Figure 1-1.
FIGURE 1-1 HYDRAIL SYSTEM STRUCTURE

The feasibility study is based on the train service pattern and rail vehicle fleet mix (locomotives and
electric multiple units [EMUs]) that Metrolinx intends to operate on the electrified GO network from
2025 on the completion of the RER program of infrastructure enhancements.
A simulation model of the operation of the Hydrail System, based on this pattern and fleet, was used
to calculate the size of the fuel cell system on the rail vehicles, the size of the electrolyzers needed to
produce the hydrogen, and the amount of electricity needed from the grid. These sizing calculations
were then used to forecast the capital cost to implement the Hydrail System and its annual operation
and maintenance (O&M) costs.

Hydrail System Design and Operation

The key factor in determining the feasibility of the Hydrail System is whether it can provide the
expected GO functional and operating performance that the RER program needs to deliver.
The feasibility study concludes that there is a good level of confidence that this can be achieved
based on the assessment of the following:


The functionality and size of the end-to-end Hydrail System



The amount of electricity the system will need to consume to produce the required volume of
hydrogen, and the ability of the system to use electricity when the hourly electricity prices are at
their lowest



The design of the fuel cell systems to be integrated into the rail vehicles to deliver the
performance needed for RER services



The modularity of the components of the system, which creates a high level of performance
redundancy



The operation of HFC-powered locomotives using an arrangement of 1 locomotive with 6
carriages, which can then be joined so that 2 locomotives pulls 12 carriages



The expected ability to refuel the HFC-powered locomotives and EMUs in time frames
comparable to current diesel locomotive refuelling



The existing commercial availability and technological performance of all components that will
be needed for the Hydrail System



The interest of the major global rail vehicle manufacturers in building HFC-powered rail vehicles
and the pending introduction of these vehicles into revenue service on other networks



The lessons learned from the Hydrail Symposium held in Toronto which are consistent with, and
supportive of, the findings and recommendations in the feasibility study

In addition, there are specific benefits that Metrolinx would experience if the Hydrail System is
implemented, instead of electrifying the GO network through the conventional overhead catenary
system, including:


Capital cost saving – The avoidance of the capital costs of the infrastructure works in the rail
corridor to install the overhead catenary system, lower the track in places, raise bridges, and
divert utilities (even though the Hydrail System has its own infrastructure works, these are
smaller in scale and will generally not interface with the live railway; this delivers a saving in the
initial investment that will need to be made in RER)



Environment – There would be fewer lineside trees required to be removed for Hydrail

However, the conventional overhead catenary system has benefits over the Hydrail System in the
following areas:


There is no requirement for refuelling – this will have a comparative benefit in terms of
operating flexibility and cost



Rail vehicle capital cost will be lower due to the HFC system equipment that will be integrated
into the HFC-powered rail vehicles



The cost of equipment renewals will be lower, as the cycle of refurbishment is longer for
conventional overhead catenary system equipment

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

The study of the Hydrail System resulted in several key design and operational conclusions, as follows:
1. The Hydrail System needs to be designed and operated as a complete end to end system. At one
end of the system are rail vehicles operating on the GO network. At the other end of the system,
power is drawn from the grid needed to produce hydrogen. The hydrogen then moves through
the system via storage tanks, distribution infrastructure, and dispensing facilities until it is stored in
tanks on the rail vehicle.
There are two main options for where the hydrogen could be produced. The first option would
use a few large facilities located away from the rail network; in this case, the hydrogen would need
to be transported to the refuelling locations by truck or pipeline. The alternative is to locate the
hydrogen production facilities near the refuelling facilities. This is the most economically
advantageous solution, and is the one that is recommended in the study.
2. One of the key advantages of the Hydrail System compared with conventional electrification is that
it can choose when to draw electricity from the grid. This means that it can take advantage of the
low prices of electricity that generally occur during the night in Ontario. By maintaining a surplus
of hydrogen in storage over what is needed every day, and choosing only to produce hydrogen
when the price of electricity is less than a certain value, it is possible to minimize the cost of Hydrail
System operations. The overhead catenary system does not have this level of flexibility, as it needs
to draw electricity from the grid when required to operate the train, regardless of the price.
3. The HFC-powered locomotive and the HFC-powered EMU will both use an HFC system. This
consists of a combination of fuel cell, battery, ultracapacitor, and regenerative braking (as shown
in Figure 1-1). The way this system will operate is that the battery and ultracapacitor are sized to
provide the power needed for the train to accelerate to its cruising speed between stations. The
fuel cell is then used to charge the batteries as the train is cruising. Then, as the train is braking for
the next station, the regenerative braking system further charges the batteries and the
ultracapacitor.
The simulation modelling work that has been undertaken as part of the feasibility study
demonstrates that HFC-powered locomotives and EMUs can be designed to deliver the required
RER services.
The benefit of the regenerative braking system is that it recovers energy from the traction motors
that are part of the vehicle’s braking system, and this energy can then also be used to charge the
batteries and utltracapacitors. Modern electric rail vehicles all have regenerative braking systems;
however, these are not generally sized to maximize the amount of energy that could be recovered.
With the Hydrail System, there will be an opportunity to consider how the onboard power
management systems are designed so that they maximize the amount of energy recovered during
braking. This could further reduce the size of the fuel cell needed and reduce the volume of
hydrogen consumed each trip.
The ability to integrate this equipment into a locomotive platform has been validated by three rail
vehicle manufacturers as part of the initial work undertaken by the HFC Locomotive Project that is
also part of the Metrolinx Hydrail Workstream (an overview of this project and the Hydrail
Workstream is provided in the Introduction section of this report).
4. The components in the Hydrail System’s subsystems are of a modular design (that is, multiple,
small tanks; fuel cells; and batteries). This means that failure, or reduced performance, of one
component should not have a significant impact on subsystem operation.

Revision B

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

For example, on the rail vehicles, the fuel cells will be arranged in parallel stacks so that a failure,
or reduced performance, of one unit will only result in the fuel cell system’s reduced output power.
Even if the entire fuel cell subsystem does become unavailable, there should be sufficient power in
the battery system to enable the rail vehicle to operate in a degraded mode so that it can reach a
place of safety. The battery subsystem would also be designed so that a failure in one battery unit
should only lead to a reduction in peak power available to accelerate the train.
5. While RER train services using conventional overhead electrification are intended to be operated
using an electric locomotive pulling 12 unpowered carriages, the Hydrail feasibility study
recommends that 2 smaller HFC locomotives are used instead of one. This is because the volume
of hydrogen needed on a single locomotive would not be sufficient to meet the service range
requirements that Metrolinx needs between refuelling cycles.
The additional benefit of using 2 locomotives with 12 carriages is that Metrolinx will have the
option of splitting the consist into 2 consists of 6 carriages and 1 locomotive for out-of-peak hours
when fewer passengers are travelling. This will reduce the operating costs of the rail network.
The concept of one locomotive with six carriages could also be used as an alternative to the
current plan to use EMUs for RER peak and off-peak services, and should be considered further.
The benefits of this would be:


The locomotives will be compliant with Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) standards
(whereas, the EMUs are compliant with International Union of Railways [UIC] standards, which
would be new to Canada).



Metrolinx will be able to continue to operate its existing fleet of bi-level carriages.

6. A key determinant of the operational efficiency of the GO network using the Hydrail System will be
the length of time that it takes to refuel a rail vehicle with hydrogen. The refuelling duration needs
to be minimized whether the refuelling takes place during nonoperational hours at the end of the
day, or during a break between trips in the daily service timetable.
Hydrogen refuelling facilities designed for use by cars and buses typically only need to transfer
low volumes of hydrogen. A facility needed to transfer the volumes required for the Hydrail
System has yet to be built. However, an integrated design between the storage on the rail vehicle
and the refuelling facility will be based on using multiple tanks on the rail vehicle that can be filled
simultaneously using a manifold system. The target refuelling time of about 30 minutes is
expected to be feasible through engineering design.
However, the need to refuel the HFC-powered rail vehicles is a disadvantage when compared to
electric rail vehicles that use the conventional overhead catenary system. This means that these
electric rail vehicles have benefits in terms of rail service operational planning because refuelling
does not need to be factored into the daily railway operating plans.
7. The technology on which the Hydrail System is based might seem like it is cutting edge and
innovative, with inherent risks relating to reliability, safety, and performance. However, all
components of the Hydrail System are based on technology that is fully developed, commercially
available, and already in use in industrial applications throughout the globe, many of them in
extremely harsh environments. This means that we are confident we will achieve a high level of
reliability from these components in a heavy railway environment.
The challenge in developing the HFC-powered rail vehicles is not so much in the performance of
the individual components of the system, but in the integration of these components into a hybrid
CPG-PGM-RPT-245

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

fuel cell system and then into the rail vehicle platform. This challenge is not to be underestimated,
as the space available on the rail vehicle is limited, and there are many design constraints that will
need to be overcome, particularly weight distribution.
However, large rail vehicle manufacturers are highly experienced in systems engineering, and
have the tools and knowledge needed to successfully undertake this integration design.
8. Further, the major rail vehicle manufacturers are showing a high level of interest in HFC-powered
trains. For example:
a. Over the course of 2017, Alstom has been testing its Coradia iLint train, which is an HFCpowered EMU, in Germany. Alstom recently announced that it had received an order for 14 of
these trains which are due to go into revenue service in 2021.
It is interesting to note that the vendor who is supplying the fuel cells to Alstom for this train is
Hydrogenics, based in Mississauga.
b. CRRC, the main Chinese rail vehicle manufacturer, has recently announced that it has
introduced into revenue service a HFC-powered light rail vehicle (LRV) in the city of Foshan
and is planning to expand this concept to other cities that have LRV projects in development.
It is also interesting to note that the vendor supplying the fuel cells to CRRC is Ballard Power
Systems (Ballard), based in Vancouver.
c. Siemens has also recently announced that it has entered into a partnership with Ballard for the
development of an HFC-powered train.
In addition, other rail vehicle manufacturers have expressed an interest to Metrolinx in
participating in the HFC Locomotive Project, which would lead to the construction of a prototype
HFC-powered locomotive.
However, in assessing the cost of procuring a fleet of HFC-powered rail vehicles there will be a
premium for these vehicles in comparison to those required for a conventional overhead catenary
system. This will be due to:
a. The manufacturer’s design costs for such vehicles being higher as there is a development
element of the work that will need to be undertaken
b. The cost of the hybrid HFC equipment that will need to be integrated into the vehicles will be
more expensive than the electrical equipment that is integrated into a conventional electric rail
vehicle
9. Installing the infrastructure required for the overhead catenary system requires a significant
amount of construction work to take place in, or near to, the rail corridor. This work includes:
a. Erection of overhead line gantries and catenary wires
b. Construction of new substations
c. Diversion of utilities
d. Lowering of the track bed in some locations, and rebuilding some bridges (to obtain the
required height clearance)
e. Modifying other bridges to erect safety walls

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

Implementing the Hydrail System would mean that this work and the associated capital costs
would be avoided.
The Hydrail System itself would require fixed infrastructure assets to be built in relation to:
a. Hydrogen production facilities
b. Transportation infrastructure
c. Storage facilities
d. Refuelling facilities
On balance, it is expected that there will be a significant cost saving in the initial capital cost of the
fixed infrastructure of the Hydrail System in comparison to that required for the conventional
overhead catenary system.
10. The Hydrail System has environmental benefits over the overhead catenary system, particularly in
reducing the total number of trees that need to be cleared along the rail corridors.

Financial Modelling

An assessment has been made of the Net Present Value (NPV) cost of implementing and operating
the Hydrail System. Using a sensitivity analysis approach, a low-cost scenario was created that has a
benefit to cost ratio (BCR) of 3.01, and a high-cost scenario was created that has a BCR of 2.65.
This compares to a BCR of 3.07 for the existing RER business case based on conventional
electrification.
These results should be qualified because they could be affected by risks and opportunities that
need to be further investigated, including the following:


Cost saving of avoiding the construction of the overhead catenary system



Forecast difference between the prices of night-time (off-peak price) electricity and day-time
(peak price) electricity



Forecast price of fuel cells



Overhaul cycle duration of fuel cells



Potential ability to share infrastructure costs with other users



Potential ability to commence RER services earlier than planned

Based on the level of design and cost analysis that it has been possible to undertake during the
feasibility study, the Hydrail System and the conventional overhead catenary system have equivalent
BCRs.
As mentioned in the previous section, the Hydrail System modelling has forecast both the system’s
capital and operating costs. These costs were then incorporated into a modified version of the RER
business case model to determine the system’s likely BCR. This has enabled the Hydrail System to be
compared to the conventionally electrified network from a financial perspective.
At this point in the assessment of the costs of the Hydrail System there are many assumptions that
have been made about the performance of the system and the likely costs of the system’s
components. To account for this uncertainty a sensitivity analysis has been run on many of the model’s
input variables. This has created a low-cost scenario, where optimistic values were set for the
variables, and a high-cost scenario, where pessimistic values were set for the variables.
The outputs of this modelling work show that:


The low-cost scenario has a BCR of 3.01



The high-cost scenario has a BCR of 2.65

This compares to a BCR of 3.07 for the existing RER business case based on conventional
electrification. These results need to be qualified as follows:

The implementation and operation costs for RER with conventional electrification are currently
being reviewed based on a more up-to-date definition of the project’s scope and prices. This will
enable the BCR to be updated and a forecast range between high and low probabilities to be
determined.



The actual costs for Hydrail could be influenced by the factors identified in the following
“Challenges” and “Opportunities” sections. There are four significant areas:
1. The price of electricity – the forecast prices of electricity between 2024 and 2035 have been
provided to us by the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) and are based on the
2017 Long Term Energy Plan for Ontario.
Over the long-term the electricity prices for the Hydrail System will depend on the extent to
which:


The current surplus of generating capacity changes



Other users of off-peak electricity enter the market

These factors could influence the price of off-peak electricity in a positive or negative direction
from the current forecast which in turn would affect the comparative difference in the
operating costs of the Hydrail System and conventional electrification.
In the context of an RER procurement process with the Hydrail System as an option, it is
recommended that certainty is provided to bidders around the long-term pricing of off-peak
electricity. This will require consideration by the provincial government.
2. The price of fuel cells – the price range of fuel cells that has been included in the financial
modelling is a result of advice from industry sources. These views are based on current
volumes of production which are relatively low compared to the production volumes of other
technology items.
Over the medium-term the price of fuel cells could reduce further if hydrogen becomes a
major factor in global strategies for decarbonization.
3. The duration between overhauls for the fuel cells – based on industry sources we have
forecast that this duration would be about 9 years for the operation of fuel cells in the Hydrail
System. However, there is a significant amount of research being undertaken on fuel cell
technology and the possibility of a further improvement in this area should not be discounted.
This would also reduce the Hydrail System’s operating costs.
4. Sharing of infrastructure implementation and operating costs – as described in the
“Opportunities” section it would be feasible to share the costs of setting-up and operating the
hydrogen production facilities with other government and private sector users if the
appropriate incentives are put in place. This could lead to an improvement in the BCR for the
Hydrail System.


The NPV of the benefits resulting from operating the Hydrail System could be improved over the
current RER business case. This could be due to:


The earlier transition to RER services that could be achieved with the Hydrail System



The broader socio-economic benefits that implementing the Hydrail System might generate



The associated commercial opportunities that the Hydrail System might enable.

Based on these qualifications, the conclusion of the financial modelling is that, at this stage, there is
good equivalence between the Hydrail System and conventional electrification and that further
analysis needs to be undertaken on both.

Challenges

Hydrail is a complex system and there are likely to be many significant implementation challenges.
The feasibility study report has assessed the key risks that could affect the program’s design and
implementation as well as the operation of the Hydrail System.
The most significant risks are:


Delays in the timescales for the development, build, and introduction into service of HFCpowered rail vehicles



Unexpected operational reliability issues with the HFC-powered rail vehicles after they enter
revenue service



Concerns from the public and Metrolinx passengers to the concept of HFC-powered rail
vehicles



Delays in achieving approval from the safety regulators to the commencement of revenue
services with HFC-powered rail vehicles

If any of these risks occurs there could be a delay in the start of RER services. It is therefore
recommended that these and the other risks identified need to be further investigated and
mitigation plans for them implemented as part of the next stage of the Hydrail Program.

Implementing a Hydrail System on the GO network will require major challenges to be overcome.
These include:


The potential for the longer-than-planned development timescales for HFC-powered rail vehicles
so that Metrolinx is unable to meet the target of 2025 for the commencement of RER services.
Metrolinx has already started mitigate this risk through the process of developing both an
HFC-powered locomotive and EMU. By commissioning rail vehicle manufacturers to prepare
conceptual designs for both types of vehicles Metrolinx will be able to validate the principles of
how an HFC-powered rail vehicle will perform.
Beyond this concept design work, the risks of time over-runs during design, build, and testing of
rail vehicles would be managed by an appointed rail vehicle manufacturer. Based on the
experience of Alstom, which took 3 years to develop and bring into testing their Coradia iLint
HFC-powered EMU, it seems feasible to expect a rail vehicle manufacture to complete the
development and build of HFC-powered trains in the time available to commence RER services in
2025.
Furthermore, Metrolinx would expect to procure an HFC-powered rail vehicle fleet on the basis
that the supplier will be responsible for any risks to achieving the specified RER reliability and
availability targets.



HFC locomotives and EMUs of the type needed for RER do not yet exist; therefore, real-world
experience relating to reliability is limited to the operation of light rail vehicles and buses.
This means that even though the vehicles will go through an extensive development and testing
process, there is still a risk that when they enter revenue service, they will experience unexpected
issues with reliability that cause in-service failures and consequential impacts to customers.

This risk also applies to the hydrogen production, storage, refuelling, and dispensing facilities;
and it is probable that the greatest risk relates to the integration of these systems. However, this
risk can be mitigated by implementing and operating a small-scale prototype of the end-to-end
system so that lessons can be learned about the system’s operation, performance, and reliability;
and so these lessons can be fed back into the design, build, and operation of the full system.


Difficulties in gaining the public’s and Metrolinx passengers’ acceptance of the concept of the
Hydrail System.
There are many myths and misunderstandings about the safety of hydrogen, which, if not
addressed, could lead to resistance to the implementation of a Hydrail System. These would need
to be addressed through a comprehensive public communication strategy that provides a
considered perspective on safety and the resulting environmental benefits of using hydrogen.
The experience of the German government’s public communications strategy in relation to
hydrogen indicates that if a similar approach is adopted by Metrolinx, the likelihood that this could
become a major challenge would be reduced.



Achieving the approval of relevant safety regulators, including Transport Canada and TSSA,
would be a key objective of developing the Hydrail System and bringing it into service.
This challenge should not pose a significant risk as codes and standards already exist for all the
components that will be used in the Hydrail System. An important consideration for Hydrail is in
the regulations that would govern the overall safety management of the Hydrail vehicles in
scenarios where there has been an accident or a component failure.It is expected that the safety
risk in this situation would be acceptable because of several factors:


Safety in design would be a key objective during the Hydrail System design phase



Metrolinx will assemble a team of world leading experts in all aspects of hydrogen and railway
safety to provide it, and the rail vehicle manufacturer, with necessary advice on design safety
and regulation development.



Metrolinx will work closely with Transport Canada and TSSA through the design, build, and
testing process to understand what rules and regulations need to be developed specifically to
cover the Hydrail System.

Opportunities

The technical and operational evaluation of the Hydrail System has focussed on understanding how
it could be implemented and operated as a standalone system. However, the Hydrail System can
also be considered as part of the broader RER Program; as part of the overall public transportation
network; and as part of the Ontario economy.
As such, there are opportunities that could be developed during the implementation of the Hydrail
System that might deliver further benefits to both Metrolinx and the Province, including being able
to:


Commence some RER services earlier than the 2025 target date for RER



Operate RER services over the entire GO network; thereby, increasing the benefits of RER

Potential opportunities to the province are:


Being able to share the Hydrail System infrastructure capital with other users of hydrogen in the
Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA)



Being a catalyst for the expansion of businesses with a hydrogen technology focus and the
associated highly-skilled jobs

Taking forward the development of those opportunities beyond Metrolinx’s transportation mandate
will require consideration and guidance from the provincial government.
Taking the Hydrail System forward as the means of electrifying the GO network provides several
opportunities to create benefits that would not be available through an overhead catenary system
network, including:


The ability to incrementally introduce the HFC-powered rail vehicles into revenue service.
This contrasts with the conventional overhead electrification program which can only commence
electrified rail services on a rail corridor once all the infrastructure is in place.
Aligning the implementation of the RER track and signalling improvements with the development
of the HFC-powered rail vehicles creates the opportunity for an initial fleet of these vehicles to be
introduced into service on one corridor earlier than the planned start of RER services in 2025. This
would enable Metrolinx to build up a level of experience in the operation and performance of the
vehicles that could be fed into the development and build of the remaining vehicles in the fleet on
the other corridors.



By adopting the Hydrail System it will be possible to eventually operate electrified RER services
over the full GO network rather than the scope of corridors that is currently planned for RER. This
means that, over time, all the remaining diesel locomotives could be removed from the network
with the additional environmental benefits in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, pollution,
and noise reductions.



Implementing the Hydrail System could act as a catalyst for a broader adoption of hydrogen
throughout Ontario as part of a potential roadmap for a hydrogen economy in Ontario1. There are

opportunities to align the Hydrail System’s hydrogen production, storage, and distribution
infrastructure with the similar infrastructure needed to support HFC-powered buses and cars. The
investment in an integrated infrastructure for these complementary requirements would be far
more cost effective than if the systems were developed individually.


There are possible broader socio-economic benefits that could be experienced by Ontario as a
result of implementing the Hydrail System. These include:


Development of opportunities for businesses in the hydrogen and the fuel cell sector. Ontario
already has some businesses that are focussed on producing components of the Hydrail
System. These businesses are likely to benefit from implementing a system on the scale of
Hydrail



This in turn is likely to lead to an expansion in the number of high skilled jobs that would be
required in these businesses and in the operation and maintenance of the Hydrail System

Taking forward the development of those opportunities which are beyond Metrolinx’s transportation
mandate will require consideration and guidance from the Provincial government.

Recommended Next Steps

While the study concludes that it is technically and economically feasible to build and operate the GO
network using HFC-powered rail vehicles, it has also identified aspects of the Hydrail System that
warrant further investigation to support the RER procurement process.
The proposed next steps are focussed on alignment with the RER procurement strategy which will be
open to both the Hydrail System and conventional electrification options.
The primary objective of this alignment is to enable the design of the whole Hydrail System to be
taken forward to a conceptual design level so that by the time the RER bidders start to prepare their
bids they will have access to high quality information about the design and operation of the Hydrail
System. This will enable the bidders to accurately assess the risks and benefits of Hydrail System in
comparison to electrification using the conventional overhead catenary system.
It is proposed that further work is undertaken in those areas of the Hydrail System where the bidders
are likely to want a greater level of certainty than currently exists, at the completion of the feasibility
study. These are:


Design:


Complete the projects to create conceptual designs for an HFC bi-level EMU and an HFC
locomotive



Refine the Hydrail System configuration and size in the Operational Simulation model, including
development of concept designs for hydrogen production, storage and fuelling subsystems



Prototyping: Commission the production of a prototype HFC locomotive that can enter revenue
service, including the development and prototyping of the refuelling and hydrogen production
subsystems that can work with the prototype HFC locomotive so that Metrolinx can learn valuable
lessons concerning the Hydrail System’s operations, performance, and reliability



Railway operations: Further investigate the operational areas of the Hydrail System such as
maintenance and refuelling



Cost: Recognizing that the Hydrail System would represent a new approach to delivering RER,
collaborate with industry vendors to further investigate infrastructure and vehicle delivery and
operational costs



Implementation: Further define the development and build phases and the transition plan
required to initiate a Hydrail System on the GO network



Hydrogen production: Identify location options for the hydrogen production facilities



Regulations: Work with the safety regulators at the federal and provincial levels to reach clarity on
the regulatory environment that will apply to Hydrail



Electricity price policy: Work with the provincial government to develop an electricity price policy
that could be applied to the Hydrail System



Hydrogen economy: Work with the provincial government to develop a cross-government
business case for hydrogen (including the Hydrail System)



Align with the RER procurement process: Integrate the outputs from these steps into a Hydrail
System Reference Concept Design that can be used in the RER procurement process

Introduction

2.1

Purpose and Objective of the Study

The Hydrail Feasibility Study Project was initiated because Metrolinx is committed to electrifying the
GO network and using hydrogen fuel cell technology to power rail vehicles is now being considered
as a viable alternative to rail vehicles powered by an overhead catenary wire system.
Therefore, the objective of the study has been to determine whether it is technologically feasible and
economically beneficial to use hydrogen fuel cell powered rail vehicles on the GO network, as an
alternative to conventional electrification.

2.2

Metrolinx Hydrail Workstream Overview

The feasibility study was undertaken as one project within a program of projects called the Metrolinx
Hydrail Workstream. The other projects in this workstream are shown on Figure 2-1.
FIGURE 2-1 THE HYDRAIL WORKSTREAM

HFC Bi-Level EMU Concept Design Project
As part of the proposed Regional Express Rail (RER) train services it is intended to operate bi-level
Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) rail vehicles in consists of four cars and eight cars. In the Hydrail System
these would be replaced by Hydrogen Fuel Cell (HFC)-powered bi-level EMUs.
The objective of this project is to commission rail vehicle manufacturers, who already have bi-level
EMU models, to produce conceptual designs for a HFC-powered bi-level EMU that can meet the
requirements of the RER service patterns.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

The conceptual designs will prove the feasibility of integrating an HFC system into an EMU and will
provide valuable information about the likely cost and timescales to develop, manufacture and bring
this type of EMU into revenue service.
HFC Locomotive Project
As part of the proposed RER train services, it is intended to operate electric locomotives pulling the
existing fleet of unpowered coaches in 12-car consists. In the Hydrail System, these would be replaced
with two smaller HFC-powered locomotives.
The objective of this project is to commission rail vehicle manufacturers, who already have electric
locomotive models, to produce conceptual designs for an HFC-powered locomotive that can meet
the requirements of the RER service patterns – in this case it will be a locomotive in a six-car consist.
Metrolinx has already completed an initial phase of work that has verified the feasibility of integrating
a HFC system into a locomotive platform. It now intends to engage rail vehicle manufacturers to take
these ideas forward to the concept design level.
The conceptual designs will further demonstrate how an HFC system can be integrated into a
locomotive platform, and will provide valuable information about the likely cost and timescales to
develop, manufacture, and bring this type of locomotive into revenue service.
At the completion of the conceptual design phase, it is Metrolinx’s intention to commission the
detailed design and construction of a prototype HFC-powered locomotive that can be used on the
GO network. This will provide multiple benefits including gaining experience operating an HFC rail
vehicle, and with the refuelling process, its maintenance requirements, it performance, and its
reliability.
Hydrail Symposium Project
As part of the scope of the Hydrail Workstream, a 1-day symposium titled “Hydrail in Ontario:
Examining Opportunities for Wireless Electrification” was held in Toronto on November 16, 2017.
The objectives of the symposium were to:


Educate and inform an audience of interested Metrolinx and government stakeholders about the
opportunities and implications of using a Hydrail System



Learn about global and Canadian developments in the use of hydrogen technologies



Obtain the views of the participants on what the key challenges would likely be if Metrolinx
implemented the Hydrail System and identify how these challenges could be overcome

The symposium was attended by more than 200 participants and key speakers included:


Steven Del Duca – Minister of Transportation



Phil Verster – Metrolinx Chief Executive Officer (CEO)



Hydrogen Overview

The objective of Part 3 is to provide the reader with an understanding of the various technologies that
underpin the use of hydrogen as a stored power source and provide examples of existing hydrogen
related projects that are relevant to the Hydrail concept.
It will include a summary of the technologies, their capabilities and current capacity plus commentary
on the maturity of these technologies. This will include:


Hydrogen generation



Storage



Distribution



Fueling



On vehicle storage



Reconversion of hydrogen to power (fuel cells), and



Ancillary equipment such as on vehicle batteries and regenerative breaking.

This is intended to provide a basis of understanding that is then used in Part 4 where the Hydrail
System, as applied to the GO network, is defined.

3.1

Introduction to Hydrogen

This section provides background knowledge on hydrogen as a fuel and energy storage solution, and
the technologies that support the hydrogen system, converting natural gas or generated electricity to
hydrogen for temporary energy storage, and back from hydrogen to electricity to power electrical
equipment. The discussion in this section provides basic information and confidence that the
technology is developed, modular, off-the-shelf, and has established levels of performance.
Hydrogen atoms permeate the Universe. Yet on Earth, while hydrogen is abundant and essential to
life, it is always chemically combined—particularly in the form of water and, to a lesser extent, as oil
and gas—because any free hydrogen quickly combines with oxygen in the air. However, there are
simple ways to produce pure hydrogen from water, hydrocarbons, or both. The simplest approach is
by passing an electric current through water, the process known as electrolysis, which can easily be
arranged to produce pure streams of hydrogen and oxygen. Every school chemistry lab routinely
demonstrates this process, which is illustrated on Figure 3-1.

FIGURE 3-1 SCHEMATIC OF WATER ELECTROLYSIS PROCESS2

Water always contains ions in the form of positively charged hydrogen ions (H+) and negatively
charged hydroxyl ions (OH-). By passing an electric current—a stream of negatively charged electrons—
H+ are neutralized and converted into molecules of hydrogen gas (H2) at the cathode. Meanwhile, at
the anode, the applied current is stripping electrons from hydroxyl ions and converting them into
molecules of oxygen gas and neutral water molecules. The only input is a substantial amount of
electrical energy; in theory, about 39.3 kilowatt-hours (kWh) to produce 1 kilogram (kg) of hydrogen.
(In practice, some electrical energy is lost, and 50 kWh/kg is typical.)
The bulk of the electrical energy is now stored in the hydrogen and can be retrieved by reversing the
electrolysis process in what is called a fuel cell. Combined with the lightness of hydrogen, the
relatively large amount of energy that is stored when water is converted into hydrogen means that the
reverse of converting hydrogen back to water is an exceptionally low-weight source of energy.
For trains, primary energy could come from onboard supplies of hydrogen; this is Hydrail. Hydrogen
is just one of a number of energy currencies and, like monetary currencies3, are interchangeable. So
Hydrail’s energy originates in electricity from the grid. The first currency conversion happens at a
convenient, fixed location where electricity is converted into hydrogen. The hydrogen is then loaded
onto trains.

Catastrophe (Canadian Hydrogen Association).

A second currency conversion occurs when hydrogen is reconverted into electricity to power the train
(Figure 3-2)4. Although it is also possible to convert hydrogen into heat energy by burning it, its direct
conversion to electricity is advantageous both because it is a more efficient conversion and because
electricity is a more versatile form of energy.

Hydrogen Production Options

Hydrogen has to be manufactured with engineered processes. Electrolysis is one of four process
technologies that can produce hydrogen, as shown in Figure 3-3.
FIGURE 3-3 HYDROGEN PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES

Fossil Carbon Processes convert the energy in hydrocarbons to pure hydrogen by several routes. The
currently predominant route to hydrogen reforms natural gas by steam-methane reforming (SMR) and
similar variations on this technology. This is an energy-efficient process, and today produces about
96 percent of the hydrogen essential to converting oil into usable refined products. However, SMR
processes also co-produce one CO2 molecule for every four molecules of hydrogen.
Using SMR and other CO2-producing variations to produce hydrogen is questionable because there is
also the possibility of producing hydrogen and pure carbon from natural gas. This is called partial
reduction. It is recognized as an interesting possibility, since the carbon is produced in a stable form
that would not require sequestration. However, partial reduction and SMR both require processing
CH4, which is a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG). Partial reduction is also an inefficient process, since it
