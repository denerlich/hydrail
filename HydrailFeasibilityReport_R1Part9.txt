Recommended Next Steps

This section recommends actions arising from the findings within this report, in relation to the further
development of the Hydrail System, in relation to the broader questions that inter-relate with the
Provincial government, and in relation to the development of the RER DBFOM.

6.1

Actions to Further Develop Hydrail

The proposed next steps for the development of the Hydrail System are focussed on the need to
maintain alignment between the development of Hydrail and the preparation activities for the RER
DBFOM procurement.
The primary objective of the proposed next steps is to enable the design of the whole Hydrail System
to be taken forward to conceptual design level so that by the time the DBFOM bidders start to
prepare their bids they will have access to high quality information about the design and operation of
the Hydrail System. This will enable the DBFOM bidders to more accurately assess the risks and
benefits of Hydrail in comparison with electrification than would otherwise be the case.
In particular, it is proposed that further work is undertaken in those areas of the Hydrail System where
the DBFOM bidders are likely to want a greater level of certainty than currently exists, at the
completion of the feasibility study. These are:


Refine the Hydrail System design in terms of system size, based on a more accurate representation
of the system configuration in the Operational Simulation model;



Comission concept designs for a HFC EMU, a HFC Locomotive and the hydrogen production,
hydrogen storage and hydrogen fuelling subsystems;



Identify preferred options for location of hydrogen production facilities for each corridor;



Confirm how the Hydrail System would function as an operational railway, particularly in areas
such as maintenance and refuelling;



Confirm the capital and operating cost estimates of the whole Hydrail System based on further
engagement with component vendors and a more formal approach to estimating infrastructure
and vehicle delivery costs;



Confirm how the Hydrail System could be implemented through its development and build
phases and particularly the transition plan of Hydrail into revenue service across the GO network;



Develop a Safety Case roadmap for Hydrail based on consultation with Transport Canada and
organizations responsible for maintaining and developing hydrogen related safety standards;



Build and operate a small-scale prototype of the Hydrail System including an HFC Locomotive.

6.1.1

System Size

The definition of the Hydrail System presented in this feasibility study is based on modelling work that
simulates how the whole system will operate every day. The Operational Simulation Model has been
specifically designed to simulate the performance of each of Hydrail’s subsystems and the design is
based on the following principles:


The fleet mix and train service pattern defined as Scenario 5 of the IBC for RER has been used to
calculate the peak and average power requirements for train trips on each GO corridor;

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT



This data is used to size (power and physical dimensions) the fuel cell and batteries on the rail
vehicles;



This in turn determines how much hydrogen is required to operate the train for each trip, which
enables the total volume of hydrogen that is needed each day to be calculated;



From this the size of the electrolyzer components has been calculated, and



From this the amount of electrical power required each day for the Hydrail System has been
calculated.

At each step in this process, assumptions have been made about the:


RER GO network infrastructure and train services from 2025 onwards, and



Functional performance of each of the components in the Hydrail subsystems

It has been necessary to make these assumptions because:


The scope of RER has been developing in parallel to the Hydrail feasibility study, and



Our access to data on forecast component functional performance has been based on estimates
from a limited number of industry sources.

It is considered by the Hydrail team that many of the assumptions in the model are quite conservative
and therefore it is the team’s view that it would be beneficial to undertake further work to improve the
accuracy of the model’s outputs.
We intend to do this by:


Improving the sophistication of the model’s algorithms to more accurately simulate the power
requirements of the rail vehicles;



Cross-referencing the algorithms in the model with those being used by the rail vehicle
manufacturers who are participating in the HFC Bi-Level EMU Concept Design and HFC
Locomotive Concept Design projects, and



Obtaining access to actual component performance data from a range of manufacturers.

6.1.2

Subsystem Concept Designs

Even though the feasibility study concludes that there are no technology-related flaws with Hydrail
and that all elements required to assemble this system already exist elsewhere in similar applications,
the scale of Hydrail is bigger than anything that has currently been implemented. As a consequence,
there are technical areas of the Hydrail System definition where the levels of uncertainty need to be
reduced so that the risk profile of these areas is comparable to those of the overhead catenary system
solution.
By undertaking subsystem concept designs a much more precise sizing of all the components of the
overall Hydrail System will be achieved. For example, it would enable us to demonstrate how the
expected fuelling time can be achieved and to assess the way in which a Hydrail network could be
operated and maintained.
This reduces these risks so that the DBFOM bidders will be better able to assess the risks and benefits
of Hydrail in comparison with electrification.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

Therefore, we intend to initiate engineering concept design studies of:
1. A HFC bi-Level EMU. A procurement process is already underway to commission a number of rail
vehicle manufacturers to produce concept designs that integrates a hybrid fuel cell system into
their existing bi-level EMU models. The output of this work will provide valuable information on
whether the performance of the HFC bi-level EMU will meet the RER requirements, the range of
the vehicle between refueling, the likely unit price of the vehicle and the phases in the
development of production models;
2. A HFC Locomotive. A procurement process has started to commission a number of rail vehicle
manufacturers to produce concept designs that integrates a hybrid fuel cell system into their
existing electric locomotive models. The output of this work will provide the same range of useful
information as for the HFC bi-level EMU;
3. A hydrogen production and storage facility of a size that would be needed for one of the GO
corridors. This will provide us with equipment layout information and component sizing and an
understanding of how the facility will be connected to the electricity grid;
4. A hydrogen refuelling and dispensing facility of a size that would be needed to refuel an HFC EMU
fleet and an HFC locomotive fleet. This will also provide us with equipment layout information and
component sizing and an understanding of how the facility will operate in its interface with the rail
vehicles. In particular, it would be designed to achieve the objective of a refuelling time that meets
the fleet operation and maintenance expectations of Metrolinx.
We intend to undertake this work by assembling a team of consultants, government agencies and
universities that we have already engaged with during the feasibility study who have specialist
knowledge and capabilities in these areas. This work wouldbe project managed by the existing
Metrolinx Hydrail team.

6.1.3

Hydrogen Production Location Identification

One of the key variables in the configuration of the Hydrail System are the proposed locations for the
hydrogen production facilities. The factors that will need to be considered in deciding on these
locations include:


The area required for the facility (this has been covered by the work described above)



The locations for rail vehicle stabling facilities in the RER program



Land that is currently available within Metrolinx’s ownership that could be suitable for such a
facility



Land that is outside Metrolinx’s ownership but is close to the proposed rail vehicle stabling
facilities



Land that is suitable for such a facility that is located at some distance from the rail network and
would be suitable to enable transportation of hydrogen by truck or pipeline to the rail network



The potential to expand the facility for hydrogen production use beyond that required for
Metrolinx’s Hydrail



The planning and permitting constraints that would relate to any identified land



The cost of purchase and/or remediation of any identified land

We intend to undertake work that will identify a range of options for the hydrogen production
locations to enable the Hydrail system to function in both its Scenario 5 and full network

configurations. We will then assess these options using the criteria of capital cost, operating cost and
planning feasibility and determine the optimized solution.
The team undertaking this work will include Metrolinx property staff and RER fleet maintenance
planning staff.

6.1.4

Operational Functionality

Although the feasibility study has not identified any flaws in how GO would operate using a Hydrail
System, there are operational processes that need to be considered in more detail to give DBFOM
bidders sufficient assurance that it is feasible to operate. These processes include:


Cyclical maintenance and renewal regimes for the rail vehicle subsystem



Refuelling the trains as part of the end of day processes



Management of degraded rail vehicle operability due to failure of a component within the hybrid
HFC subsystem



Response to degraded rail services that prevents access to a refuelling facility



Start of day and end of day routines for the rail vehicle subsystem



Operational and maintenance routines for the hydrogen production, storage and transportation
subsystems

We intend to create system diagrams for each of these processes so that it is clear how a Hydrail
System would integrate with the railway operational processes that DBFOM bidders will be familiar
with from operating railway systems based on overhead catenary system of electrification.

6.1.5

Cost Estimates

The feasibility study has identified all the key capital and operating cost components in the Hydrail
System. The cost values that have been used in the Operational Simulation Model have been
obtained for information provided by discussions with industry sources and have been validated
against published data.
As a result of the further system sizing work, concept design work and hydrogen production facility
location work that we have identified above it will be possible to undertake a more formal cost
estimating exercise of the capital and operating costs. This will also be accompanied by a quantified
risk assessment to more accurately evaluate the forecast cost distribution for different risk parameters.
As part of this process there will be a further evaluation of the forecast prices of electricity that it is
appropriate to use in the calculation of the Hydrail System’s operating cost.

6.1.6

Implementation Plan

Section 4.11 of this report provides an initial view of how the Hydrail System could transition into initial
operation. As stated in that section there are many interdependencies of a physical and a timing
nature between the RER program’s infrastructure upgrades and the Hydrail System.
We intend to work with the RER planning team so that we can create a more detailed transition
scenario that integrates with the proposed sequence of infrastructure work and identifies:


Which corridor would be best suited for the initial testing of the HFC rail vehicles



Which corridor would be best suited for the initial revenue service



The preferred sequence of corridors that would then introduce the service and how this would
relate to the incremental build of the hydrogen production, storage and dispensing facilities

6.1.7

Safety Case Roadmap

Section 4.6 of this report provides an overview of the existing codes and standards that apply to
hydrogen systems and identifies the need to undertake work that will:


Assess the risks relating to the operation of the Hydrail System



The development of further codes and standards for the operation of the Hydrail System
particularly in relation to the refuelling subsystem and the rail vehicle subsystem

During the feasibility study the Hydrail team has commenced engagement with Transport Canada and
held initial discussions with them about evaluating the safety risk of the Hydrail System concept.
In taking forward this area of work the Hydrail team intends to form a working committee that will
include Transport Canada, TSSA, CSA, the Canadian Hydrogen Installation Code Standards
Committee and equivalents in the United States. The objective of this group will be to develop a
pathway for the development of a full suite of codes and standards that will apply to Hydrail.

6.1.8

Prototype Hydrail System

Irrespective of how much systems modelling and concept design work is undertaken the complete
viability of the Hydrail System can only be demonstrated by designing, building and operating an
example of the complete end to end system.
At the conclusion of the above activities Metrolinx intends to:


Commission the building of a single prototype HFC Locomotive that can enter revenue service



Commission the development and prototyping of the refueling and hydrogen production subsystems that can work with the prototype HFC Locomotive.

Operating this prototype Hydrail System over an extended period will enable Metrolinx to learn
valuable lessons concerning Hydrail System’s operations, performance and reliability which can then
be fed back into the design and implementation planning of a full Hydrail System.

6.2

Actions to Align the Hydrail System with Provincial
Government Policy

6.2.1

Electricity Price Policy

As outlined in Section 4.4, the calculation of the net present value of the operating cost of the Hydrail
System is sensitive to the forecast hourly prices of electricity from 2025 onwards. For the Hydrail
System to retain its BCR equivalence to the conventional overhead electrification system, the
differential between the average off-peak price of electricity to the average peak price of electricity
needs to remain at the level used in this analysis (which is: off-peak = 0.4 x peak).
Therefore, any narrowing of the differential between the price of electricity paid by Hydrail and that
for conventional electrification would weaken the economic case for Hydrail. Due to the many
variables that could influence the price of off-peak electricity in the future this is considered to be a
highly significant risk (as described in 4.12.3.1).
As a consequence, this risk needs to be mitigated to avoid DBFOM bidders including a substantial
risk premium into their operating cost calculations for the Hydrail System. A recommended next step
is therefore for Metrolinx to engage with the provincial government to determine if it is possible to
define, or pre-establish, the cost of electricity relating to the Hydrail System.

6.2.2

Hydrogen Economy

As outlined in Section 4.9.1, there are opportunities for the Hydrail System to be a catalyst for the
broader adoption of hydrogen in the Ontario economy. As described in Section 4.12.4.4, the benefits
of this Hydrogen Economy concept could be:


Sharing of the costs of implementing the fixed infrastructure assets



Reductions in the use of fossil fuels as energy sources



Development of businesses and jobs with a hydrogen technology focus



The development of Ontario as a global leader in the implementation of hydrogen technologies



Adoption of hydrogen as an energy storage material in combination with renewable energy
sources and the associated benefits in relation to the stabilisation of the electricity grid in response
to variations in demand.

Taking forward the development of those opportunities, which are beyond Metrolinx’s transportation
mandate, will require consideration and guidance from the provincial government, and potentially
part of a broader “hydrogen roadmap”. A recommended next step is therefore to work with the
provincial government to develop a cross-government business case for an Ontario Hydrogen
Economy.

Actions to Integrate the Hydrail System into the
DBFOM Procurement Process

As stated at the start of Section 6.1 one of the objectives of the “Recommended Next Steps” is to
provide high quality information on the Hydrail System to the DBFOM bidders.
As such the Hydrail team will work with the Metrolinx team that is managing the DBFOM procurement
process over the course of 2018 to ensure that the activities to further develop the Hydrail System
concept are aligned with the DBFOM’s timescales and objectives.

Appendix A – Symposium Feedback
A.1.

Introduction

A Hydrail Symposium was conducted by Metrolinx to solicit, gather and analyze feedback from
qualified members of the public, key stakeholders in the Hydrogen industry and private sector
companies that are active in the Hydrogen space. Feedback was solicited in 5 key areas: safety,
implementation, environment, energy and workforce. The key objectives and challenges facing
Metrolinx for each of these categories was gathered from the perspective of the audience. The
common themes around each of these areas are highlight below.
Safety
The Key Objectives identified in the safety category include:


Ensuring adequate training for the entire workforce is conducted as the workforce will need to be
very familiar with the technology to operate and maintain the system, particularly rail operation.
This is best done through a formal and structured training program



Ensuring codes, standards and regulations that are already in place are well known within the
study and key areas of deficiency are identified



Providing proper knowledge transfer to the public through a public education campaign that
shows hydrogen being safe to use; and developing the appropriate methodology of making this
communication effective



Adopting risk assessments to tie in with the communications strategy and comparing to other
energy systems so a proper risk benefit analysis can be conducted

The Key Challenges identified in the safety category include:


Controlling misinformation about Hydrail. In terms of public perception, understanding of
hydrogen is low and this could possibly be the biggest challenge to making it work from a safety
perspective. Getting the public to understand the technology will be very difficult since perception
of safety issues will have to be separated from real safety issues. This will require the support of
media and key government officials



Working with the government and regulatory bodies to develop adequate regulations will be
another challenge since the integration of hydrogen on a rail vehicle has never been done on the
RER scale before

Implementation
The Key Objectives identified in the implementation category include:


Implementing a pilot project immediately with both small and large scale-testing, with a phased-in
approach. This way, the system can be slowly adjusted to accommodate RER, learn lessons along
the way to meet the 2024/25 deadline. The phased-in approach also reduces risk



Develop and maintain stakeholder and government involvement, as well as partnerships with
other organizations



Investing the time and effort to nail down the mechanics of refueling (frequency, cost, and who will
operate) and gather all analytics prior to implementing to deliver on time and on budget. The
process should not be rushed

The Key Challenges identified in the implementation category include:


Delivering on time as per the provincial government promise (which affect public perception) and
maintaining reliability are crucial since Metrolinx will only have one chance at a first impression



Managing costs and expectations from planning, to initiation, to full life cycle is thought to be
difficult



Finding a one-size-fits-all solution for refuelling/hydrogen production given GTHA’s varied
geography, track/station layouts is thought to be another hurdle that could dramatically increase
costs



Implementing/protecting the program if the minister or government changes is to be looked at so
efforts and investments are not wasted

Environment
The Key Objectives identified in the environment category include:


Clearly communicating the environmental benefits of hydrogen to the public, in comparison with
overhead catenary and capturing all pertinent data including air quality, avoiding tree cutting,
GHG reduction, and noise reduction



Managing life cycle costs to ensure all decisions are based on lifetime costs and carbon usage.

Appendix B – Hydrail Safety Review
B.1.

Introduction

The objective of this hydrogen safety review is to assess the hydrogen hazards for the Hydrail System
to identify unresolved safety issues or gaps in the exiting hydrogen installation standards and codes
that would make it unfeasible to use HFC-powered trains.
The scope of this work is to perform a preliminary hydrogen safety review for the Hydrail concept that
consists of the following six system components (shown in Figure B-1):
1. Hydrogen production
2. Hydrogen storage (production site)
3. Hydrogen distribution
4. Hydrogen refill (storage)
5. Hydrogen dispensing
6. Hydrogen vehicle
This safety review will identify the main parts, failures, consequences, potential hazards and
preventative measures. Assessment of the severity or frequency for each failure is outside the scope of
work. The work scope also includes a review of the legal, regulatory & standards that pertain to the
Hydrail System.

Hydrogen Properties Relevant to Hydrogen Safety

B.2.1. Forms of Hydrogen
Hydrogen, the simplest and lightest element on the periodic table, is composed of only one proton
and one electron. Pure hydrogen exists in the form of hydrogen molecules. It coexists in two different
forms, ortho (nuclear spins aligned) and para (spins anti-aligned) hydrogen, whose partition is
dependent on the temperature. Normal hydrogen at room temperature is 75 percent ortho and
25 percent para. Hydrogen can exist in gaseous, liquid, or slush forms. The normal boiling and
melting points of hydrogen is 20.3 K and 14.1 K, respectively, at the absolute pressure of 101.325 kPa.

B.2.2. Physical Properties of Hydrogen
The physical properties of hydrogen relevant to safety are summarized as follows220:


At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colourless, tasteless, odorless, non-toxic,
and non-corrosive gas. It is the lightest gas, being 1/14 as dense as air. It is positively buoyant
above a temperature of 22 K, i.e., over almost the entire temperature range of its gaseous state.



Because of its small size, small molecular weight and low viscosity, H2 has an enhanced propensity
to leak. Rates of any leakage are enhanced by a factor of 50 higher than for water and 10 for
nitrogen.



In a pure hydrogen environment, hydrogen molecules collide with each other and bonds can be
broken. H+ can penetrate barrier diaphragms. At elevated temperatures and pressures, hydrogen
can cause severe decarburization and embrittlement for steels. This is a serious concern in any
situation involving storage or transfer of H2 under pressure.



Liquid hydrogen (LH2) is a colourless, odourless, and non-corrosive liquid. It is relatively
unreactive. It is categorized as a cryogenic fluid (<-73°C). Any liquid hydrogen splashed on to the
skin or in the eyes can cause serious burns by frostbite or hypothermia. LH2 will rapidly boil or
flash at all temperatures above its boiling point of 20 K. When evaporated from open LH2 pools,
cold H2 is more viscous than ambient gas and thus more prone to the formation of a flammable
mixture with air. In confined areas, when LH2 is heated up to ambient conditions, the local
atmosphere may change drastically due to the volume increase.

B.2.3. Gas Mixing
H2 by itself is harmless, save for asphyxiation. It must be mixed with air in the right proportion to form
combustible mixtures. The severity of combustion is strongly dependent upon the hydrogen
concentration in air. H2 mixing in air is by two transport processes; mass diffusion and convection.
Diffusion is the transport process in which the rate of transport of hydrogen is directly proportional to,
and in the opposite direction of, the hydrogen concentration gradient in the hydrogen-air mixture.
Diffusion will reduce the hydrogen concentration gradients and over time will result in a uniform
distribution.
Convection is the transport process where the gas mixture is moved in the opposite direction of the
pressure gradient. This movement of gases has local differences in momentum and velocity
(magnitude and direction) which creates eddies and turbulences that result in mixing of the gas

constituents. There are two types of convection. The first is forced convection whereby the gases are
moved by active systems such as a fan (part of a ventilation system) or a strong wind. The other type of
convection is called free convection which is due to buoyancy that results from local gas density
differences. With hydrogen being significantly lighter than air, the buoyancy forces are very strong,
helping to move the hydrogen upwards. As it moves upwards, it mixes with the entrained air and
becomes diluted, spreading outwards. This strong positive buoyancy of hydrogen is a favourable
safety feature in unconfined areas, but can cause a hazardous situation in (partially) confined spaces,
where the hydrogen can accumulate, e.g., underneath a roof. The rapid mixing of hydrogen with air
can lead to flammable mixtures very quickly, but on the other hand dilute mixtures to the nonflammable range quickly too.

B.2.4. Combustion
Owing to its small molecule size, hydrogen is particularly prone to leakage within a system or to the
surroundings. A potential fire hazard always exists when hydrogen is present and an oxidant exists
due to its reactivity. A hydrogen flame is colourless. Any visibility is caused by impurities.
The hydrogen properties that make it more prone to combustion are summarized as follows221:


Almost all metals and non-metals react with hydrogen at high temperatures.



Mixtures containing 4 to 75 percent H2 by volume in air or up to 94 percent in oxygen are
flammable. The detonable range is given to be 18 - 59 percent H2 in air, however, the range was
found to depend on the system size.



The minimum ignition energy is 0.02 mJ for H2-air mixtures, much lower than hydrocarbon-air
mixtures. A weak spark or the electrostatic discharge by a flow of pressurized H2 gas or by a
person (~10 mJ) would suffice for an ignition.



The burning velocity is 2.6 m/s for stoichiometric H2 in air and 11.8 m/s in pure oxygen, much
higher than other hydrocarbon fuels because of its fast chemical kinetics and high diffusivity.
Higher burning velocities produce rapid pressure rises and greater chance for a transition from
deflagration to detonation (DDT).



Hydrogen produces more heat per unit mass (LHV = 120,000 kJ/kg) than any other automotive
fuel, but a relatively low heating value per unit of volume unless compressed or liquefied.



At one atmosphere, the quenching distance is about 0.06 cm for hydrogen compared to 0.2 cm
for propane.

Combustion of premixed H2-air mixtures can occur as a deflagration or detonation. Both forms are
often regarded as an "explosion”. When hydrogen is leaked in the form of a jet, typically at a failed
static or dynamic seal, the jet of hydrogen will mix with air and possibly form a jet fire (or so-called
diffusion flame or standing flame). The characteristics of each combustion form are defined as follows:


A deflagration is a subsonic wave with typical velocities on the order of several meters per second.
It is also an expansion wave with both pressure and density decreasing across the reaction front.
The propagation of a deflagration is caused by the diffusion and convection of heat and
intermediate reaction species from the flame to the unburned gas. The deflagration pressure is
spatially uniform and bounded by the adiabatic isochoric (constant volume) complete combustion
(AICC) pressure. For stoichiometric H2-air mixtures, the AICC pressure of confined deflagration

is 8.3 atm at ambient temperature and pressure. In contrast, the deflagration overpressure of an
unconfined hydrogen-air gas cloud is in the order of 10 kPa.


A detonation, the most energetic form of combustion, is a supersonic wave, with typical velocities
on the order of a few kilometers per second. It is a compression shock wave with pressure and
density increasing across the wave. It is caused by heating of the unburned gas via a shock wave
(created by the energy release in the reaction zone) to temperatures capable of causing ignition in
the unburned gas. As a result, the reaction front is coupled to the shock wave and they propagate
at the same velocity. The detonation velocity for hydrogen is in the range of 2000 m/s and the
pressure ratio across a detonation wave is approximately 15 for stoichiometric H2-air mixture.

A detonation can be initiated directly via strong ignition sources, such as high energy explosives,
strong shock waves and high voltage discharges. However, it is more often initiated by a process that
starts from a deflagration and accelerates to a fast flame and transition to detonation (so-called DDT).


Diffusion flames take place when fuel and oxidizer are physically separate so that the energy
release is limited primarily by the mixing process. The fuel and oxidizer mixing may occur in two
ways: (1) molecular diffusion, where mixing is relatively slow and (2) turbulent mass transfer or
eddy diffusion, where mass transfer is much more rapid. Flame length is an essential measure of
jet fire, which is the distance that all the jet fluid has mixed and reacted with the atmosphere.

B.2.5. Material Interaction
Hydrogen is relatively inert towards most solid materials that may be used to contain it. However, it is
such a small molecule, it can penetrate many materials at normal temperatures. In some materials, this
means it permeates and can be lost from a container. In other materials, the hydrogen can enter the
material structure and change its properties. Most metallic and ceramic materials are relatively
impervious to hydrogen, whereas many polymers are to some degree permeable.

B.2.5.1 Hydrogen Embrittlement
The mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement in structural metals is not well-understood, but it is related
to the ability of hydrogen to dissociate or move around in and between the metal crystal structures. A
few metals have structures that allow significant permeation of hydrogen at ambient or modest
temperatures. Some of these are commonly used for containing gases and can suffer significant loss
of ductility when exposed to hydrogen or if hydrogen is incorporated during fabrication. This effect is
dependent on the metal microstructure, metal stress, certain impurities (metal or hydrogen),
temperature and hydrogen pressure. High-strength steel is the most common material of particular
concern; whereas, mild steel, austenitic stainless steel, aluminum, and copper alloys are considered to
be largely safe from the effect when not exposed at high temperature. The main means of avoiding
hydrogen embrittlement is by careful selection of materials and designs that limit stress
concentrations. Embrittlement is most often a result of incorporation of hydrogenated compounds
during welding and heat treatment rather than simple exposure to H2.

B.2.5.2 Hydrogen Permeation
Hydrogen can diffuse through some engineering polymers at rates sufficient to be of concern from
the point of view of flammability or loss of gas. The range of permeability is very broad and can vary
by at least 2 orders of magnitude between different types of polymers, but typically elastomers are
significantly more permeable than rigid materials. There is normally no chemical interaction; the
process is purely physical—a combination of solubility and diffusivity. In practice, the concerns will be

mostly at mechanical piping connections with elastomer seals (e.g. flanges) or in very high-pressure
H2 storage vessels made with polymeric materials.

B.3.

Hazard Assessment of Hydrail System Components

B.3.1. Hydrogen Production
For the Hydrail project, hydrogen production is by low-temperature electrolysis of water in a large
industrial installation. Water electrolysis is a very well-established technology, with very well
understood process components and methods of controlling the hazards. From the electrolysis unit,
the hydrogen will be compressed for storage as gas, or compressed, cooled and liquefied for storage
as liquid. This, too, is a well-established industrial process.
An industrial plant specifically for the sole purpose of hydrogen production is well positioned to be
engineered with active and passive features to minimize hydrogen hazards for all operational and
failure modes. It is standard procedure to perform a formalized hazards and operability study, Failure
Modes and Effects Analysis, or both during the design of a new plant. The major concern is
flammability of hydrogen and most of the hydrogen-related safety features are designed first to limit
the ability of hydrogen to mix with air, then to ensure any unwanted mixing stays below the lower
flammability limit and finally to avoid the presence of sources of ignition. Table B-1 briefly lists the
failures, hazards and mitigation measures for hydrogen production.

B.3.2. Hydrogen Storage (Production Site)
B.3.2.1 Gaseous Hydrogen
Gaseous storage of hydrogen is assumed to be in relatively low pressure compressed gas tanks.
Weight is not an issue, so it seems logical to rule out Class III and IV, which are more expensive. Type I
is the lowest cost, and generally consists of a seamless steel or aluminum tank with a maximum
pressure of 25 MPa. Type II consists of a seamless metallic tank, but hoop wrapped with fibre resin to
increase its maximum pressure to 45-80 MPa. Type II is more costly than Type I because of the fibre
resin wrap.
A quick internet search found the largest commercially available hydrogen storage tank had a
capacity of showed that commercially available hydrogen storage tanks have a 15 m3 capacity
(30 MPa). To meet the hydrogen storage requirements for the Hydrail project will require hundreds of
these tanks.
Hundreds of 30 MPa storage tanks (commercially available 30 MPa hydrogen storage tanks have a
maximum capacity of about 15 m3) will be needed to store the thousands of cubic metres of hydrogen
required by the Hydrail project. This will require a significant amount of piping and valving to move
the hydrogen to all these distributed tanks. These tanks will also need valves (including check valves)
to allow each tank to be isolated, so that in the event a pressurization event occurs for one tank and
the pressure relief device or temperature/pressure relief device activates, only the affected tank will
release its content.
An assessment of the hazards for gaseous hydrogen storage at the production site is shown in
Table B-2. Many of the failures leads to a release of hydrogen from either the storage tank or the
attached components (e.g. pipes, fittings, pressure relief devices). This hydrogen release can result in
a formation of a combustible cloud. The hydrogen release can also result in a standing flame at the

release point. Large sudden releases can also result in over-pressurization of a confined space. The
general preventative measures to protect from the potential hazards for a hydrogen release are:




Located in a confined space:


Periodic inspection and leak testing



Barriers to protect against external impacts



Exclusion zone


No ignition sources



No obstructions to aid in flame acceleration/DDT



Limited personnel access



Ventilation is required to guard against hydrogen accumulation. However, Ventilation may not
be sufficient for large sudden releases. Blow-out panels (needed for protection against
pressurization) will need to be located to aid in venting of hydrogen.



Blow out panels to protect the confined space against pressurization due to large sudden
releases of H2 or pressurization due to combustion.



Pressure monitoring and warning system for unexpected depressurization of the component

Two other failure mechanisms need further discussion. The first is the possible introduction of air into
the system to form a combustible hydrogen-air mixture within the tank/pipes. The preventative
measure is to monitor for the presence of oxygen (or air) in the tanks/pipes. The second failure is
related to the temperature and pressure relief devices used to protect the storage tanks from failure
due to over-pressurization. They are designed to remain open once activated. Their preventative
measures include limiting the vent size to adequately provide pressure protection, but also to limit the
size of the hydrogen cloud. As well, the vent should be directed away from personnel, energy sources
and control/safety systems. These TPRD/PRD will also require protection against ice build-up.

B.3.2.2 Liquid Hydrogen
Liquid hydrogen is stored at low (cryogenic, -245°C) temperatures and at pressures of 0.6 MPa. The
liquid hydrogen storage is a Dewar, double-walled, vacuum-insulated vessel made of steel alloys. The
inherent heat transfer from the surroundings, through the vessel walls will cause the hydrogen to
evaporate/boil inside the tank. This build-up of hydrogen causes a pressure rise inside the vessel. The

H2 is vented to maintain a vessel pressure below its normal operating pressure (about 0.6 MPa). The
amount of hydrogen released vented is called boil-off. The main components of a liquid hydrogen
tank are:


Double-walled, vacuum insulated vessel made of steel alloys



Shut-off devices



Boil-off system



Pressure relief devices (PRDs)



The interconnecting piping and fittings between the components

NASA stores its liquid hydrogen in a 3,218 m3 vacuum bottle, which is more than 5 times the
estimated amount of liquid hydrogen required for the Hydrail project. This indicates that all liquid
hydrogen needed for the Hydrail project can be stored in one vessel. This would make a liquid
hydrogen storage facility much simpler logistically. However, a failure of one component can result in
the discharge of the entire volume of liquid hydrogen.
An assessment of the hazards for liquid hydrogen storage at the production site is shown in Table B-3.
A release of liquid hydrogen would vaporize upon contacting the outside environment (its
vaporization rate will be dependent upon the rate of heat transfer to the liquid hydrogen) to form a
relative cold H2 cloud with a possibility to form a heavier than air hydrogen cloud that can remain
grounded. As well, the lower temperatures of the H2 will reduce its buoyancy and diffusion with air.
Asphyxiation is more of a possibility, even in unconfined space. The resulting hydrogen cloud can also
be combusted. The preventative measures for liquid hydrogen release includes:


Common:


Periodic inspection



Barriers to protect against external impacts



Exclusion zone


No ignition sources



No obstructions to aid in flame acceleration/DDT



Limited personnel access



Liquid hydrogen liquid level monitoring and warning system for unexpected loss of liquid
hydrogen



Liquid hydrogen temperature monitoring and warning system for unexpected rise in
temperature.



Select materials that are less susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement (low carbon, low allow
and low strength steels are less susceptible)



Isolation from heat sources



Direct liquid hydrogen flow to safe areas





Located in a confined space:


Ventilation may not be sufficient. Blow-out panels (needed for protection against
pressurization) will need to be located to aid in venting of hydrogen.

Blow out panels to protect against pressurization due to high expansion ratio for liquid
hydrogen to gas.



Hydrogen detection and warning system

Located in an unconfined space:


Underlying these preventative measures is the importance of maintaining the integrity of the vacuum
insulation between the inner and outer walls of the liquid hydrogen storage tank.
If the release path is connected to the gas space of the liquid storage system, then gaseous hydrogen
will be released, but limited to the boil-off rate. The same potential hazards and preventative
measures for gaseous hydrogen storage would apply.

B.3.3. Hydrogen Distribution
Hydrogen can be transported and distributed from a centralized production site to the consumer by
compressed gas using pipelines or by compressed gas or liquid using ships, railways or road tankers.
Hydrogen pipeline delivery is considered a cost-effective way to move hydrogen from its production
location to end users, though usually only at large volumes. The cost to construct a large-scale,
dedicated hydrogen pipeline system can be very high depending on the distance and capacity. An
alternative delivery pathway for large volume and long distance is to use the existing natural gas
pipelines by blending hydrogen with the natural gas222 . The pipeline delivery system usually consists
of compressor stations, transmission (mains) and distribution (customers) lines, regulators and meters.
The potential hazards associated with transport of gaseous hydrogen using existing natural gas
pipelines are summarized in Table B-4. The primary prevention measures for the pipeline associated
with fire or explosion are:


Regular in-line inspection



Leak detection or cathodic protection monitoring system



Sufficient venting in confined service areas



Limited H2 fraction in the blends with natural gas (i.e., less than 50 percent).

Road transport of gaseous hydrogen is presently carried out using trucks with steel cylinders of up to
90 litres at 200 – 250 bar pressure or large seamless cylinders called “tubes” of up to 3000 litres at
200 – 250 bar. For transport in larger scale, pressure of up to 500-600 bars or even higher may be
employed. However, a 40-ton truck can only carry 400 kg compressed hydrogen because of the
weight of a 200 bar pressure vessel. The gaseous hydrogen distribution by trailers consists of
pressurized tubes, connection hose and PRD. The potential hazards associated with transport of
pressurized gaseous hydrogen by tube trailers are summarized in Table B-5.
Liquid hydrogen road transport using a cryogenic tank is carried out using trucks which can exceed a
capacity of 60,000 litres. However, liquefaction process is both time consuming and energy
demanding. Liquid hydrogen is difficult to store over a long period (loss by vaporization) and the

insulated tank may be large and bulky. The liquid hydrogen delivery system consists of storage tanks
(inner and outer tanks), connecting hose, heat exchanger and pressure regulating valves. The
potential hazards associated with transport of liquid hydrogen by road are summarized in Table B-6.
The primary prevention measures for both delivery methods associated with fire or explosion are:


Regular inspection of the storage tanks and PRD



Sufficient driver training for unloading and re-fill and operating procedure



H2 detection system in the loading and staging area



Separation distance between loading vehicles and from H2 fill to gasoline storage

B.3.4. Hydrogen Refill (Local storage at refuelling site)
B.3.4.1 Gaseous Hydrogen
The Hydrail project proposes to store gaseous hydrogen at refilling stations at 87.5 MPa. This can be
accommodated by TYPE II and IV gaseous hydrogen storage tanks. Type II consists of a seamless
metallic tank, hoop wrapped with fibre resin to increase its maximum pressure to 45-80 MPa
(literature suggests that the maximum pressure for Type II tanks are unlimited). Type IV hydrogen
storage tanks employ a non-metallic liner (e.g. plastic as a permeation barrier) wrapped in a
fibre/epoxy matrix (for strength). Literature search indicates that most of the research/development of
Type IV tanks are for use in cars, with working pressure of 70 to 80 MPa. These maximum pressures for
Type II and IV tanks may not meet the Hydrail requirement to store gaseous hydrogen at 87.5 MPa.
Thus, a booster compressor would be required to meet the pressure needed to fill the 70 MPa onboard storage tanks (on the trains). Type IV tanks are significantly lighter than Type II, but with a
significantly higher cost. The weight of the storage tanks is not a factor for stationary hydrogen
storage at a refilling station. Thus, it is recommended that gaseous hydrogen be stored in Type II
hydrogen storage tanks at the refilling stations. Hazards associated with Type II gaseous hydrogen
storage is already covered in Table B-2 and discussed in Section 3.2.1. The only difference being the
higher-pressure tanks will result in higher hydrogen release rates from a break (in the tank wall) as
compared to the gaseous hydrogen stored in lower pressures storage tanks at production sites.

B.3.4.2 Liquid Hydrogen
Liquid storage at the hydrogen refilling station is essentially the same as liquid hydrogen storage at
the production site, except for a lower storage volume. Thus, the hazards assessment for liquid
hydrogen storage (production site) shown in Table B-3 and discussed in Section 3.2.2 would apply for
liquid hydrogen storage at the refilling station.

B.3.5. Hydrogen Dispensing
The fueling dispenser contains controls, fuel metering, and a connection from the fueling hose Error!
Reference source not found.]. It draws fuel from the hydrogen refill storage tanks and the controls
determine the final fill pressure on the vehicle. The dispenser meters the quantity of fuel transferred to
achieve the design pressure. The potential hazards associated with dispensing gaseous hydrogen are
summarized in Table B-7 and in Table B-8 for liquid hydrogen. The primary prevention measures for
fire or explosion for dispensing are:


Regular inspection of the cascade control, dispensing hose and nozzle, and emergency shut offs



Leak check prior to fill



Isolation vales for breakaway connection and shut off valves for dispenser

B.3.6. Hydrogen Vehicle (On-train use of hydrogen)
The passenger train can be driven by either a single locomotive with fuel storage, fuel cells and
batteries aboard, a single locomotive and a fuel tender, or an EMU consisting of separately driven
units with fuel storage, fuel cells, and batteries aboard each. The hazards associated with each part of
the power generation system on a train are not significantly different from the case for stationary
systems such as already discussed for hydrogen storage and distribution. However, combining the
equipment necessary for powering the train in a small space creates additional hazards and making
them mobile with passengers nearby further complicates the safety considerations.
If the greatest concern is for the large amount of hydrogen stored in the tanks, this may advocate for a
design that uses a fuel tender to separate the fuel from the engine and the passengers. It may also
lead to the use of gaseous storage with multiple independently isolatable tanks to limit the volume of
hydrogen released from a tank rupture. In addition, compressed hydrogen stored in roof
compartments helps ensure that any release is most likely to vent away from people.
The potential hazards associated with the three parts of the power system are summarized in
Table B-9 to Table B-11.

B.3.7. Summary
The potential hazards for the different component failures for the Hydrail system are outlined in
Sections 3.1 to 3.6. Although there are potential hazards associated with the use of hydrogen,
preventative measures are available that can be employed to prevent or mitigate the impact of the
potential hazards. Thus, there are no unresolvable safety issues surrounding the use of hydrogen for
the Hydrail system.
Many of the failures leads to release of hydrogen that leads to formation of combustible hydrogen-air
mixtures with the potential for a fire or explosion. Safety analysis will need to be performed to study
hydrogen dispersion and combustion for these failures/accidents. This will require the use of qualified
computer codes that are supported by validation against relevant experimental datasets.
