This partial ownership by the freight railroads limits the expansion capability beyond the current RER
electrification scenario, as shown on Figure , to a completely electrified solution. The need to carry
double-stacked containers on the freight railroads is the primary reason why those sections of the
network cannot be electrified.

FIGURE C-3 RER CURRENT ELECTRIFICATION SCENARIO236

The network is also shared with VIA and Amtrak. Although they do have access to a portion of the
network, and some of the Union Station tracks and platforms are dedicated for their operation,
because they do not own any of this infrastructure, they do not impose any specific requirements to
the rolling stock technology that can be operated on GO.
VIA is currently considering replacing its existing aging fleet in the Quebec-Windsor corridor. Given
the current electrification projects in the Montreal and Toronto area, and potential construction of new
electrified tracks to offer high-frequency intercity rail service, VIA is also considering the procurement
of a trainset that could operate in diesel and electric modes. If electrification was not implemented in
the Toronto area, this could modify or simplify the technology that VIA is presently specifying, and
would require operation in diesel mode in the Toronto area.
