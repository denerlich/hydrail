230 Leak of gaseous hydrogen into vacuum space will result in loss of vacuum. If pressure in the vacuum space rises sufficiently, it will activate the vacuum jacket pressure relief device and
release gaseous hydrogen to the environment.

Appendix C – Ontario Rail Sector
This section provides an overall description of Ontario’s rail sector, including its geography,
organizational structure, and bilateral arrangements in the context of regulations and legislation. This
sets the background for the sections on system design, regulations and standards, and
implementation.

C.1.1. Rail Market and Regulatory Overview
The Ontario Rail Market is served by a multitude of different passenger and freight service providers
that can be grouped in different sectors, as follows:


National Operators: VIA Rail (VIA), CP, and CN



International Services: Amtrak, CN, CP, and CSX Corporation



Regional Passenger and Freight Operators: Ontario Northland Railway and KWG Resources
(KWG)



Regional Passenger Operators: GO, Union Pearson (UP) Express, Algoma Central Railway, and
Moose Consortium Inc. (Moose)



Local and Regional Freight Operators: Cando Ltd, Essex Terminal Railway, Goderich Exeter
Railway, Huron Central Railway, Ontario Southland Railway, Ottawa Valley Railway, Port Colborne
Harbour Railway, Southern Ontario Railway, Vale Railway (Vale), and VIP Rail



Tourist Services: Agawa Canyon Tour Train, Credit Valley Explorer, Huntsville & Lake of Bays
Railway, Port Stanley Terminal Railway, and many other operators dedicated to a single operating
site



Metros and Trams: Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) Metro and streetcars or light rail vehicles
(LRVs), Ottawa O-train light rapid transit (LRT), and in the near future, the Confederation Line and
other upcoming LRV service expansion in Waterloo

Some of those service providers may be able to operate under special operating conditions or
adaptation of existing rules, but this is only possible if they operate on their own dedicated rail
network, have no interaction with other rolling stock equipment, or both.
This is not the case for Metrolinx RER, one of the largest infrastructure programs ever undertaken by
the Government of Ontario that will transform how people move across the Greater Toronto and
Hamilton Area (GTHA). As demonstrated on Figure , the GO rail network already interacts with
multiple rail network and rolling stock technologies.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

As such, any new equipment that needs to be introduced on this corridor, including new passenger
coaches or new powered cars (diesel, electric, hybrid hydrogen, or any other propulsion mode), will
need to meet a list of existing Canadian regulatory requirements, standards, and recommended
practices. For example, as a minimum, rolling stock equipment will need to be designed to comply
with the following:


Railway Safety Act (RSA), including locomotive emissions regulations



Transport Canada standards, including:


Transport Canada Railway Locomotive Inspection and Safety Rules



Transport Canada TC-O-0-26 Railway Passenger Car Inspection and Safety Rules



Rules for the Installation and Testing of Air Reservoirs (Other than on Locomotive)



Railway Freight and Passenger Train Brake Inspection and Safety Rules



Rules Respecting Track Safety (TC E-54)



Standards Respecting Railway Clearances (TC E-05)



Railway Safety Appliance Standards Regulations, Canadian Transport Commission General
Order Number (No.) O-10



Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) standards



Canada Labour Code



Canadian Environmental Protection Act



Canada Occupational Safety and Health Regulations (OSHA)



Onboard Trains Occupational Health and Safety



Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)



CSA standards

Because some of the equipment operated on the GO network has been designed with United States
(U.S.) standards, and because those requirements are not necessarily covered by Canadian
regulations, the U.S. ADA, as well as the following U.S. organizations’ standards, or portions of them,
would also be applicable to new equipment design:


American Public Transportation Association (APTA)



National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)



U.S. Environmental Protection Agency



FRA



Association of American Railroads (AAR)



ASTM International (ASTM)



In addition to these requirements, Metrolinx may also have their own sets of O&M guidelines or
specific requirements that will also need to be considered for all new rolling stock equipment.

C.1.2. The GO Transit Network
Since May 1967, GO has evolved from a single GO train line along Lake Ontario’s shoreline into an
extensive network of train lines and bus routes. GO operates seven train lines - Lakeshore West,
Milton, Kitchener, Barrie, Richmond Hill, Stouffville, and Lakeshore East - serving 64 stations over
488 route-kilometres (km), as illustrated on Figure . GO also operates an air-rail link, called the UP
Express. This service operates every 15 minutes between Union Station and Pearson Airport, with a
journey time of 25 minutes.
FIGURE C-2 GO TRANSIT OPERATIONAL LINES

Although GO owns most of its operating network, it also needs to operate on infrastructure owned
and operated by CN and CP, as previously depicted on Figure (refer to Section 4.1.1). Table C-1
presents the track ownership for all corridors operated by GO, expressed in kilometres of tracks for
each segment. Over the entire 488-km network, 390 km, or 80 percent, of GO operates on
infrastructure it owns. Lakeshore East, Barrie, Stouffville, and UP Express are 100 percent owned,
meaning there are no additional requirements before new equipment can be tested or enter into
passenger revenue service on those corridors, as described in Section 4.1.1.
This is not the case for Lakeshore West, Milton, Kitchener, and Richmond Hill corridors that need to be
operated on infrastructure owned by either CN or CP, or both. For those cases, additional reviews,
inspections, and approvals will be required by the owner(s) of the infrastructure before the equipment
would be allowed to operate.
CN transports more than $250 billion worth of goods annually for a wide range of business sectors,
ranging from resource products, to manufactured products, to consumer goods, across a rail network
of approximately 32,000 route-km spanning Canada and mid-America.

The following list illustrates the type of data and test results required by equipment manufacturers
before any passenger train equipment can be considered for operation on any CN rail lines:


Dimensional data



Wheelset and suspension standards



Clearance outline



Journal bearing heat detection



Track-train dynamics





Truck curving force performance

Track circuit shunting and detection of
wheel sets, and activation of signals



Curve negotiation



Brake equipment



Vertical track impact forces



Safety appliances



Structural strength



Propulsion system



Coupling compatibility



Prior service experience

Similar considerations are also required for CP.
